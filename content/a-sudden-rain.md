<em>

Every once in a while,  
I remember you.  
Not always,  
Not even yesterday.  
It was today.  
Every memory of you,  
it is fresh in my mind.  
Maybe, this time, science failed,  
memories do live in the heart.  
Though it burns, and hurts,  
it's a pain of love,  
that I'll get to experience.  
Even a single picture of you,  
brings back countless memories.  
I can only imagine,  
experiences you been through.  
I'll never know.  
But, my teenage is entirely you,  
And sometimes, all my todays.  
I don't think I,  
can ever forget your eyes,  
the first time I saw you  
from that small window.  
I can never forget my urge,  
to save you a seat near me.  
Not caring about anyone else,  
it was a boon,  
a strength yet a weakness.  
Glimpses of your muddy shoes,  
and us under the same umbrella.  
Memories of you,  
smiling,  
and,  
your pink stained shirt.  
It's keeps me warm,  
when I feel low.  
The fire you've lit,  
it keeps burning inside me,  
eternal,  
since I met you.  
Yet, I'll never get that chance,  
to share that warmth with you.  
The time may pass,  
the seasons may change,  
and the world may rewrite itself.  
But, you're always there,  
hidden under my cold heart.  
Just waiting for a memory,  
a spark,  
to pick me up,  
to push me forward.  
No matter what happens,  
you'll always be my love.  
My first ever.  
My external sunshine.  
My ethereal possession.  
In my daydreams,  
in my memories,  
always with me.  
Forever.  
Hoping.  
I'll never,  
see you again.

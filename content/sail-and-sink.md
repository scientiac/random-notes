.

some ships sail and some sink down,  
some request and some order loud,  
some suggest and some seek control,  
some just care and some insecure,  
some love bites and some scars,
some romantics, others try hards,  
some love and some simp trips,  
some notice and some are creeps,  
some emotional, some babies weep,  
some support and some judge weak,  
some admire and some too close,  
some are good but not all those.

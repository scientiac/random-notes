          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/how-you-can-use-this-writing-setup/">&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s start from the beginning. I made this blog to write stuff daily without giving too much thoughts on it, to  see my progress on topics that may be controversial and how I am improving on it. [&lt;em&gt;Things that I have a very crude understanding of but still have opinions on.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically have two personas here, one the writer me and another the commenter&#x2F;explainer me. [&lt;em&gt;Hey! that&#x27;s me!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] So, judging me entirely by this blog alone will be like judging a kid for making mistakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;interactions&quot;&gt;Interactions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blabbering in the wind just doesn&#x27;t cut it for a learning process. This might calm me down but it wont give me clarity. I might get clarity by researching things by myself but I want a natural approach. Someone envisioned that communnications in the web can also be decentralized as well as interactive and drafted the concept of webmentions, and that resonated with me. As opposed to communicating via a social media being limited to their visual design, I wanted something that had structure but still can be personalized.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make this into a template and not just my personal site because I found out that there aren&#x27;t many people who use webmentions as a form of communication. And if there are, they aren&#x27;t someone who would interact to my silly ramblings. Also, this site is heavily inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manuelmoreale.com&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;welcome-to-manus-website&quot;&gt;Manu&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; site because of it&#x27;s simplicity [&lt;em&gt;(I don&#x27;t credit him enough, this design it so brilliant.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], but I added a bunch of complexities to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;characterstics&quot;&gt;Characterstics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; static site generator. [&lt;em&gt;Because it is rust, and is easy to install and use than hugo.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple and uses my hand written CSS [...again! Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manuelmoreale.com&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;welcome-to-manus-website&quot;&gt;Manu&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; blog.] and no JS.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has tags to categorize posts. [&lt;em&gt;Because, why not?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmention.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;webmention.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the listener for webmentions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmention.app&#x2F;docs#using-the-command-line&quot;&gt;webmention.app command line&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and zola generated RSS feed for sending webmentions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pages&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;actions&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;workflows-and-actions&#x2F;workflows&quot;&gt;GitHub Workflows&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for hosting and checking the webmentions periodically.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A custom style for [&lt;em&gt;&quot;inner voice&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] which you can use while writing the post. &lt;code&gt;[_Hi_]&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; becomes [&lt;em&gt;Hi&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Though I like to shit on GitHub for being a monopoly and for being Microsoft, I can&#x27;t deny the fact that they give free access to workflows and pages.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the default CSS and layout is good, I encourage you to tweak the layouts [&lt;em&gt;(&#x2F;templates)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and change the CSS to make it personal to you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-by-step-instructions&quot;&gt;Step by Step Instructions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Fork and clone &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scientiac&#x2F;blog.carboxide&#x2F;&quot;&gt;this&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; repo.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scientiac&#x2F;blog.carboxide
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make it yours.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;  with your information [&lt;em&gt;getthing the URLs wrong will result in pages not linking properly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and fill everything correctly.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
[&lt;em&gt;Email is necessary for creating and verifying your indieweb account.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;static&#x2F;CNAME&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with your domain and replace &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;static&#x2F;thumbnail.png&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with your profile picture.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to install &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;zola&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on your system and test the site locally using &lt;code&gt;zola serve&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the files in &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;author&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;now&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to write about yourself.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If everyting is correct push the changes to the GitHub repo.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;In the config you can use themes for syntax highlighting from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getzola.org&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;#syntax-highlighting&quot;&gt;the zola docs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Give GitHub actions the necessary permission to write to your repo.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Actions &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Workflow permissions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Read and write permissions&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Re-run the workflow if it had failed previously.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Run the workflow and then enable the pages.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
After the GitHub action successfully runs, go to &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Pages &amp;gt; Build and Deployment&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and select &lt;code&gt;Deploy from a branch&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;\root&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on Branch.
Add your domain name to &lt;code&gt;Custom domain&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; if you have one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Check if the site is published.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Go to the website and see if everything is working properly. Only if your website is published go to the next step.
Verify your &lt;code&gt;h-card&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiewebify.me&#x2F;validate-h-card&#x2F;&quot;&gt;indiewebify.me&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and see if everything is correct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Make a webmention.io account.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmention.io&quot;&gt;webmention.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and put your website URL in there.
It will automatically detect your email address. Then, verify your email to log in.
Go to &lt;code&gt;settings &amp;gt; API Key&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and copy it to your clipboard.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Save your API secret on GitHub.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Go to GitHub &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Secrets and variables &amp;gt; Actions &amp;gt; Repository secrets&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and click on &lt;code&gt;New repository secret&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Add &lt;code&gt;WEBMENTION_TOKEN&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and the API key you copied as the &lt;code&gt;Secret&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; then click on &lt;code&gt;Add Secret&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Add the proper workflows.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
After you have the page working and webmention.io set up. Remove the current workflow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Then move the workflows directory from the root to &lt;code&gt;.github&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;# from the project root
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;rm&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt; -rf&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; .&#x2F;.github&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;mv&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; .&#x2F;workflows&#x2F; .&#x2F;.github&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally push the changes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Verify that everything is working correctly.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Check if all the GitHub actions run successfully and nothing fails.
Verify everything in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiewebify.me&quot;&gt;indiewebify.me&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. [&lt;em&gt;It is fine if &lt;strong&gt;Syndicated Copies&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; shows an error.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Finally write your posts.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Write your posts by making a markdown file in &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;content&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with the proper header like in the example &lt;code&gt;&#x2F;content&#x2F;one.md&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
If you use Nix then use &lt;code&gt;direnv&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; to enable the nix shell which automatically installs zola for you. You also get a command called &lt;code&gt;now&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that you can run to get the properly formatted datetime for the post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you write a post and try to push to the repo, it might fail because the workflow pulled the webmentions from webmentions.io and merged it to your repo. It is fine to force push to publish the changes. If not, then remember to pull and merge the changes before you push.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sending-webmentions&quot;&gt;Sending Webmentions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to send Webmentions, the content should be formatted accordingly. In general I like to utilize three activities to send Webmentions.
[&lt;em&gt;It is preferred to only use one activity for one mention.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mention&quot;&gt;Mention&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can mention a site using webmention by simply putting the link to the page being mentioned.
The site will get the webmention if it supports it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;md&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;&quot; class=&quot;language-md &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot; data-lang=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[I love learning things](&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de&#x2F;learning&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) by faulty.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;or
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;href&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de&#x2F;learning&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I love learning things&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; by faulty.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;like&quot;&gt;Like&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can like a post using webmention by formatting the link as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;md&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;&quot; class=&quot;language-md &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot; data-lang=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I like how faulty talks about learning in &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;class&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;u-like-of&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;href&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de&#x2F;learning&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I love learning things&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how faulty talks about learning in &lt;a class=&quot;u-like-of&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de&#x2F;learning&#x2F;&quot;&gt;I love learning things&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reply&quot;&gt;Reply&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can reply to a post by formatting the link and the text as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;md&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#fdf6e3;color:#657b83;&quot; class=&quot;language-md &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-md&quot; data-lang=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;class&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;u-in-reply-to&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#b58900;&quot;&gt;href&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2aa198;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faulty.carboxi.de&#x2F;learning&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#839496;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I love learning things&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#268bd2;&quot;&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#93a1a1;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel the same about learning. Nice writing faulty!
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally&quot;&gt;Finally&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this to introduce people to webmentions and increase interactions using it. I encourage writing both goofy and serious stuff. [&lt;em&gt;And even stupid stuff.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And most importantly I incourage people to customize the hell out of this base, changing and tweaking css and html without breaking the indieweb structure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Happy writing!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/creation-consumption-trying-testing/">&lt;!-- Creation, Consumption --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some years now [&lt;em&gt;meaning: many years now&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I have been into Linux and with being in the Linux &quot;ecosystem&quot; I have grown a taste in what kinds of software I use and like to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s the software that is Free and Open Source, that respects your privacy. [&lt;em&gt;If they can&#x27;t show you what they do with your inputs then they can&#x27;t be trusted.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, this mentality of &quot;software should respect my privacy&quot; severely limits the things I try. When I was young and carefree [&lt;em&gt;I am still young, but not carefree.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I used to try every new thing that I came across, no matter what it was, what philosophy it followed, what it did to my data, no matter anything. But, now I don&#x27;t do that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I try to test things, I feel bad, I feel like I am going against my belief system, against my personality. Because most of the products that come out, doesn&#x27;t tick my boxes.
They might be proprietary, or by some big tech, or having many trackers, or collecting too much data, asking for my personal information etc. [&lt;em&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like a problem, right? I mean, it&#x27;s a good thing to be conscious.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I miss trying out every new thing that came out. I used to make an account for everything as soon as I knew about them. I used to sign up for beta&#x2F;alpha testing for random projects. But, now a days I am hating on things I haven&#x27;t even tried or used. I first judge them by the cover, then by their licence and only by what they can do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved [&lt;em&gt;still do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] change, I yearned for things to change very often. Holding grudges and being &quot;in the state of unhappiness for a long time&quot; wasn&#x27;t something I did, or wanted to do and it&#x27;s something I am feeling very often now-a-days. It was because I didn&#x27;t care about &quot;many people&quot; I only cared and thought about the one I was interacting to. But, now when I am surrounded by many people and they know me by some way, it is very difficult to suddenly move on from something I have been caused harm by to feeling no dislike&#x2F;hatred toward it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I am trying to say is that things seem to be more permanent and fragile these days. But before, I used to quickly fix things up if things happened, like it was clay with just a minor fixable dent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;But now, the idea of fixing things up before it became permanent, seems weak and insecure, without confidence, without resilience, without personality.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;When does confidence turn into stubbornness? I don&#x27;t want to look like a &quot;Coward&quot; who keeps changing their mind and forgetting and forgiving the bad things and betrayals they have faced. I want to be bold. But, when does boldness turn into resentment, estrangement or just that other English word that convey the exact meaning but I don&#x27;t know it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Or maybe I have gotten the meaning of cowardice all wrong. Well, it&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t learned from books but from friends, family, and society.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Well that was a tangent!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes want to give up on privacy and try every new thing that comes up in the internet. Then the guilt kicks in and I just cannot do it, especially if it requires a login. Previously, I used to log in with my pseudonym everywhere. But nowadays I have fallen back to using my real name and primary email for people in the masses because I see other people not caring much about their real name being in use. [&lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t know where I got the idea that my real name should not be in the internet, maybe it felt stealthy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the search for the perfect thing, I am losing out on many steppingstones to reach a valid goal.
I don&#x27;t like C#, or Flutter or React Native because of big tech. I always liked C because it was what the kernel was written in and is the mother of all languages.
But, I am most attracted by rust and beyond rust there are not many languages that attract me apart from the uniqueness and &quot;stealthiness&quot; of languages like Haskell and Lisp.
I don&#x27;t like C++ for no reason at all because I have heard many people bashing on C++ and telling how great rust is, so why would I learn a language that is hated a lot.
I want to know the things in low level yet I struggle even in highest of levels, I sometimes even struggle in &quot;bash&quot;.
Something I got into unknowingly, Linux, is something I quiet understand. So, there is an example there, if I hadn&#x27;t struggled in Linux in the first place I wouldn&#x27;t have the capacity to understand at the level that I do now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my personality of immediately showing off the things I have done to people isn&#x27;t a great thing as a personality. Because, I tend to do it only if I can finish it quickly and show it off. The lack of patience is my motivation to be fast but the motivation to do things fast comes with the cost of not being to learn the things with a steep learning curve.
[&lt;em&gt;This makes me feel like I have reached the edge and I cannot jump to the other side because it&#x27;s too far. And I don&#x27;t have the willpower to go all the way around the cliff since I have come this far.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I think I should swallow my pride and keep quiet for some time. But, will it help?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;The problem seems to be seeking external validation after all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] One way to still showcase and learn may be documenting the process of learning something. But, I fear spending more time documenting and less time actually learning the thing. [&lt;em&gt;Why I am worrying about spending more time documenting? Because I feel like I have wasted so much time that I need to now compensate the time I have lost, which isn&#x27;t helping.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall &quot;invest&quot; time now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Belief System</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 20:53:09 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/belief-system/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/belief-system/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/belief-system/">&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a belief system. A system of being confident on &lt;em&gt;what is good and
what is bad&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. [&lt;em&gt;or what is bad but good and what is good but is bad&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Also a belief of who I am and who I will be. [&lt;em&gt;or who I want to be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Beliefs on what is necessary and what isn&#x27;t. A belief of how a person should behave
and how one shouldn&#x27;t. These beliefs make the identity and personality of
the person.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to multiple circumstances I have become a person that is sceptical about
everything. I try to find out what would be the best way to do something instead
of doing the very thing. I want the best [&lt;em&gt;I mean, who doesn&#x27;t?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. I don&#x27;t want
to be incorrect, I don&#x27;t want to get punished, or scolded on, or face the consequences
of my choices. I want the very thing that the majority would agree on so I don&#x27;t
get humility. I want what the person in front of me wants. I want what my loved ones
want. [&lt;em&gt;am I forever scared?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;this has caused me to not like people at all, people in general, because no one likes
everyone and everyone hates someone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the two people I love disagree with each other and I agree with both.
Can I not see both of them having valid reasons? Should one always lose in a
conversation or an argument? [&lt;em&gt;if I know correctly, one never loses a conversation
or a discussion but an argument&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] So, if two people are arguing on their perspectives
and both have valid arguments, who wins? Of course the &lt;strong&gt;powerful&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; one wins.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;that was a tangent, I didn&#x27;t mean to not talk about beliefs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what I believe in. And I am not sure if I want to be known with a certain
tag; leftist, pessimist, anarchist, sceptic, black, racist, conservative, misogynist etc.
&quot;&lt;strong&gt;You can be anything you want.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#x27;t care about the others.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&quot; are some bullshit
advises. The entire existence has a meaning only because there are observers (us) in the
existence. So, if others&#x2F;observers didn&#x27;t matter, we would be savages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While observers matter, every observer is different and the sum of agreement between all
observers is net zero. So, even if I breaths there might be one who wants me to not be
breathing at all. [&lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t like people for a reason&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the solution? Wipe out all the observers? Wipe yourself out of existence?
When everything or myself are at stake, the above advises seem like they were the better
options all along. So, am I now better off being a savage? Am I only writing this because
I lack discipline? Do I not know how not to think in a binary manner? I can try.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Living&quot; or &quot;Dead&quot; - &quot;Nonexistent&quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot; - &quot;Unknown&quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Bad&quot; - &quot;With Side Effects&quot;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&quot;Known Knowns&quot; or &quot;Known Unknowns&quot; = &quot;Unknown Unknowns&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in science because it promises the truth in a binary fashion. I believe
in change because it is inevitable. But, embracing the change, I have forgotten how
I can use arrogance. I have forgotten to make a point with confidence. I am never
sure if the thing I said is correct or if I made a mistake. I am not sure if something
I did was good because it&#x27;s ripple may cause damage to someone else. Is it fine if I
don&#x27;t know who got hurt trying to do good. Is ignorance bliss.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is legality sufficient or do I need to have ethics? If ethics is necessary, how much?
Development of AI is a good thing, but is it worth people&#x27;s creativity fading out.
Banning a platform to prevent scams and frauds is a good thing but is it worth
affecting the users that used the same platform for the good reasons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;everything ends with a question and I am not sure on anything, what I am sure at
is that this isn&#x27;t the personality I want&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics isn&#x27;t difficult afterall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a thing I constantly fear.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That, one day, I will come across you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That, one day, I will have to face you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One day, what I don&#x27;t want happens.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Old habits that push me down.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Fighting!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
With my consciousness that pulls me back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Bac...Back-off!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s hard to fight with myself.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
My subconscious self.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Who is better than being me than myself.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Does things that I cannot do.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Each step I take, you carry me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Don&#x27;t let me fall.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But the same friend is my foe.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I fall harder with the false truth you carry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Bec...Because of me?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! And No!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I was the one who told you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That, it was correct.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Because, I didn&#x27;t know better.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I didn&#x27;t know, that, you wouldn&#x27;t forget.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I didn&#x27;t know, I&#x27;d have to forget.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Make you forget.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Naivety killed the cat.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;W...W...Was I right?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely right!&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That&#x27;s the correct question.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
No! You were not.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t have to be.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s your nature to be fast.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Not, &quot;correct&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Wh...why bl...blame me then?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, I am failing to teach you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tech you new things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I am failing to relearn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Relearn the true truth.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What almost killed you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Almost killed me. Us.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You are[&lt;em&gt;aa..I am&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]too arrogant.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

          <title>The Wrong Way to Love</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:20:55 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/the-wrong-way-to-love/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/the-wrong-way-to-love/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/the-wrong-way-to-love/">&lt;em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories and the poems,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
they are lies.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love wasn&#x27;t easy, they said.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
To believe in them was my fault.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Tried to do what no one can.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Loved with force,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
thought I could handle it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thought love was to be selfless.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thought I was putting you first.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should have listened to you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Should have run away then.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Made you my victim, you&#x27;re true.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Men who try to love, they&#x27;re wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Sacrifice isn&#x27;t love, it&#x27;s stupidity.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You don&#x27;t want to be stupid.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I mistook effort for love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And she did too, we were wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I was never to give you what you wanted.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
One loves what they earn, not what&#x27;s free.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Seeing you smile wasn&#x27;t love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
That was what I got paid with,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for doing what you wanted.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Gifts? That&#x27;s buying a piece of memory,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for you to keep thinking of me.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Quick pleasures were wrong, that wasn&#x27;t love&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
that was arrogance.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Trust wasn&#x27;t love, that was blindness.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Treating you like you were above all,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wasn&#x27;t love; it was weakness.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Listening to your stories, to not do it wrong,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wasn&#x27;t love; it was cowardice.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I made a fool out of myself for thinking&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I could ask for love with love.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
No, love isn&#x27;t spontaneous, it&#x27;s bought.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s bought by being strong and arrogant.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s bought by letting them earn.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
A poison you give to them,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
for the good they&#x27;ve done.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is where you&#x27;re wrong, I thought.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But, I know now.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is a weakness, it&#x27;s a disease.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It makes you sick and then keeps you weak.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t blame you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You tried and failed.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You didn&#x27;t know the rules.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You did nothing wrong, that was your fault.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is to be wrong and accept it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is to harm; admit it.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thought all the stars were to be aligned,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I was wrong.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I should have never learned,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
what you tried to teach.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I should have never become,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
what you wanted to make.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is neither respect nor acceptance.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It is something else.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Love is not what we had. I&#x27;m sorry.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
But, I learned some things.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Meaning love isn&#x27;t love,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
saying it loud - is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Showing respect isn&#x27;t love,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
telling it - is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Caring you isn&#x27;t love,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
saying you care - is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Thinking of you isn&#x27;t love,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
saying I do - is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I don&#x27;t know what love is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
What I know is.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It is not you and I.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was never you and I.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Letting you go,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
wasn&#x27;t enough love you deserved,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
so, I am letting you grow.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
To show that I still love you a lot,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
I put you out of your misery.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Now, I see,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
you&#x27;re strong,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
like you were, when I first saw you,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It&#x27;s proved,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
what love couldn&#x27;t do in years,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
hate did in seconds.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You are beautiful, like you were,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
before I met you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You&#x27;re brave, like you were,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
before I heard you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
You are lovely, like you were,&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
before I trapped you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
It was so easy to love you.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
And I loved you wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>When to Ignore and When to Run Away</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:52:35 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/when-to-ignore-and-when-to-run-away/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/when-to-ignore-and-when-to-run-away/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/when-to-ignore-and-when-to-run-away/">&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know when it to ignore things and when it is to run away from it.
You should run away from danger, and you should never ignore anything?
[&lt;em&gt;I wish there was a written instruction set for it. (I would still not read
it but I wish there was one.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I have been ignoring and running away from
things for way to long for me to realize &quot;facing&quot; something is an option too.
Conquering the inconveniences and facing the problems instead of ignoring them.
[&lt;em&gt;Was the correct choice, but well ignoring and running away was the easier
more comfortable choice.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I have always kept myself relative to others, like If it were the other
person&#x27;s fault, but they seem to not apologize for it instead be arrogant
about their behaviour, I would eventually come into conclusion that maybe
it was my fault.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;Having clarity on a view is a good trait to have.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;To be able to know that you are correct and the facts back you.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;But, maybe a need for conclusions is stopping me for having eventual
clarity.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I am too focused about the outcome that I miss the learning
part in the process of getting that outcome.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;It is like not watching
a series unless you are sure to finish it in one go. Or, choosing a movie
because it&#x27;ll end.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I am very impatient.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I write because I want to
go through a thought process without drawing conclusions.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;And, also I
tend to forget things quickly.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am running away from many things, and in that process of running
I have jumped and skipped what should have made me a &quot;better person&quot;. I
cannot go back in time, and I am angry with myself that I lost time not
learning about things. [&lt;em&gt;If you are reading this thinking that I have now
recovered from what I lost then you are very naive.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I hate to admit
that it is very difficult to recover, but It is, and I feel like I will not
recover from it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is why I am questioning myself on how I will recover, what should I
run from, what should I now ignore to cover up what I have lost while still
being on par with what I should learn. [&lt;em&gt;But, it&#x27;s a paradox and one can&#x27;t know
what to ignore without facing it and realizing why it should be ignored.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I wrote above, I think I now know that &quot;ignoring&quot; and &quot;running away&quot;
are not the same thing. That I should not run away from social media and ignore
it. [&lt;em&gt;Like, I should not run away from the people I have broken friendship with
and ignore them.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But, I hate that instead of thinking about what I want to
think about [&lt;em&gt;(functional programming, digital logic, monads, memory management,
garbage collection, etc.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I am thinking about what should have been general
knowledge without anything to think about [&lt;em&gt;(feminism, right&#x2F;wrong, friendship,
learning, regrets, behaviour, manners, respect, anger, my people, other
people, personas, etc)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], I sometimes feel like I should have studied
psychology instead of engineering. [&lt;em&gt;I hate that the list of things I want to
focus on ended because I could not think about more topics, while I thought
that I wrote too many items that I should end it with an &quot;etc&quot; for the list
of things, I don&#x27;t want to think about.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be wrong if I said that I haven&#x27;t learned a lot by thinking about the
things I didn&#x27;t want to think about, but those things should not have takes my
brain cycles [&lt;em&gt;(I like to think like I lose my CPU (brain) cycles the more I use
my brain.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I regret writing this? Yes! Because I wasted an hour of my precious time
before my exam instead of studying. Do I feel good writing this? Yes! Because I
don&#x27;t have interest in the subject which is a result of not getting the basics
of what the subject wants to teach me and which is a result of me not caring
about it because I didn&#x27;t know about some of the topics beforehand and now
I have to give an exam to prove that I know about it which I don&#x27;t and I am
currently ignoring my problem and taking the &quot;easy&quot; way to get that dopamine
while I am not watching YouTube. [&lt;em&gt;Yeah! I am really really fucked up.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want to run away either, and I can&#x27;t stop ignoring either because my
brain is not built for patience and hard work and I just can&#x27;t keep my focus
for more than a moment. The problem is me being addicted to my laptop and at
the same time having to use it because all the resource to ruin me are in it
and all the resources to bring me back up is in it as well. [&lt;em&gt;And it is soo
easy to ruin myself than to do the hard work and get myself up.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Yet I don&#x27;t want to die, or live as a burden to my family, with neither
me being happy nor everyone who is &quot;not me&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to what I realized by watching a movie to waste more time before
my exam is that, the time I used being comfortable will be compensated by
very uncomfortable times in the future and the time I spend being uncomfortable
now will be compensated by comfort in the future. Overall, life seems to balance
out everything before eventually ending.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I guess, the key was to keep life a little uncomfortable forever and embracing
the discomfort as a way of living that it became normal and indifferent
to you.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, the time for me to follow that has already passed, and I need to make
myself a lot stronger than what I am now because the uncomfortable times are
here and I must not waste what is essentially a second chance.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, I don&#x27;t want to believe in god for the rest of my life if I fail to bring
myself up.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/psychedelics/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/psychedelics/">&lt;p&gt;The easiest thing to do these days is to spend time doing nothing and forget the things
that needs to be done. I can turn my mind off and just float in this state
where I don&#x27;t have to worry about how it might affect the future. [&lt;em&gt;No,
I am not talking about the butterfly effect.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I am not bored, I am lazy.
There is a difference, which I didn&#x27;t seem to realize. Boredom is not having
things to do while laziness is not having the will to do the things you want
to do. [&lt;em&gt;Yeah! You want to do it, but you don&#x27;t want to do it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;You want the
result and don&#x27;t want the effort it takes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life should have been easy by now. A discipline, a way of doing things, a flow
on how and when to do things, I should have figured out all those things and
streamlined and optimized my life for what I want the most. But, I am stuck on
leaving everything out and floating in a different plane, forgetting everything.
No! I am not talking about drugs. I am talking about something way worse than
drugs. [&lt;em&gt;The fact that the power in my area should cut off just for me to
accept that I am in the real world, says it all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should accept it as addiction. I feel like it is an integral part of my life
and also my personality. It is an integral part of everyone&#x27;s life because it is
literally one of the basic human rights, &lt;strong&gt;communication&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. [&lt;em&gt;Maybe, I didn&#x27;t
fact check it, but it seems like a fundamental human right to me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And you
don&#x27;t need to know me just to realize that the next thing I am most likely to
talk about after Linux is &lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned almost everything down. I disabled all feeds of YouTube, I deactivated
Facebook and also messenger, and that was almost entirely what I used. But, the
fact that I can just enable things isn&#x27;t helping. And it isn&#x27;t enough to
disable things to solve the problems. I have to disable them from myself,
only then I will be free from it. [&lt;em&gt;After all the blame for how I make my
life is on me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I didn&#x27;t completely disable everything. I had made an account on LinkedIn
[&lt;em&gt;Yeah, I know, very disappointing.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and when I am tired of scrolling YouTube,
I go there and scroll the feed just to get something different and somehow
coming back to YouTube. [&lt;em&gt;But, you said you disabled all feeds from YouTube.
Yes, and I can re-enable it too.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I do have mastodon and Pixelfed but scrolling
them takes like 1 minute before I am caught up with everyone I follow and what
they have shared, and I begin to see everything I already saw the last time with
no recommendations and curiosity to scroll any further. I also scroll hacker
news and lobsters, and they are exhaustive as well. Then I have my RSS feed
which also is exhaustive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the problem? The problem is that I am completely inactive during the
daytime. I just can not do anything during the day. [&lt;em&gt;I realize I have made
myself like this, I wish I could blame this to someone else.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Daytime, it&#x27;s
almost eight hours of a day before I call it evening or morning and not daytime.
And, the tendency to just pat myself and say that I will do &quot;something&quot; in the
morning or evening or at night doesn&#x27;t help either because what is stopping me
from wasting all my time doomscrolling and searching for something?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And instead of worrying about the things I must do, I just use this psychedelic
glowing box, let it take control over my senses and just forget about the world
in a second. I can&#x27;t spend two days without YouTube recommendations without
having various withdrawal symptoms and eventually finding a way to get the
YouTube dosage, be it by re-enabling feeds or watching it without feeling
guilty somehow. [&lt;em&gt;On the TV or on someone else&#x27;s phone.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] It is almost like
a smoker who has quit smoking wanting to breathe the smokey air around them
if they get a chance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to somehow get rid of this addiction and make &quot;good habits&quot;. I don&#x27;t want
to feel like I am being forced to not do the things, not use social media and
I just want to feel indifferent about it. In the most relatable way; I just want
to break up with social media in bad terms and realize that It wasn&#x27;t good
or bad for me, I made it &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To quote it swiftly, &quot;It&#x27;s me, yeah! I&#x27;m the problem, it&#x27;s me.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/untitled2082/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/untitled2082/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/untitled2082/">&lt;p&gt;So, it&#x27;s 2082 B.S. [&lt;em&gt;Not Bullshit, Bikram Sambat, like AD but for Nepali
Calendar.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I am living in the same age as you are, not the future. This is
just our calender system. And I wanted to write some clean slate style text
here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a love hate relationship with love and hate. I have been through
loving and hating and finally being indifferent to the same person.
Though, if you graphed the time I spent loving to hating, the hating
part would be negligible. [&lt;em&gt;But it is still hating, and it should count.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Well, on that note, I treated &quot;relations and the things we do in it&quot; like a
barter system, like, I thought I deserved the same amount of love in return
for what I gave. [&lt;em&gt;Love is unexhaustive, or is it? That&#x27;s a topic for some
other day.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I mean, I believe the same &quot;belief&quot; I had about love similar to
barter system, that, people deserve the same love they give to others was why
she &quot;loved&quot; me. [&lt;em&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know it was love or just a barter return.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] It
may be the same thing as falling in love with a character of a series.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love what you can predict.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are unpredictable creatures, no one knows what&#x27;s going on other peoples
mind. So, to fall in love or to be able to predict that the person will not hurt
you or listen to you or whatever you think a person should do when they love
you, is almost impossible. And the fact that there should be a two-way situation
for the thing I just described makes it even more impossible. So, is love
impossible? [&lt;em&gt;You might say that it&#x27;s not. And yes, people still fall in love.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
So, what is it? It&#x27;s a compromise between two people to forgive the
unpredictability in the hope that they will be predictable again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love until you can control.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, there is unconditional love. &quot;Unconditional&quot; being the condition for
love, which people don&#x27;t realize. How do you forgive a person in the hopes that
they won&#x27;t do the same thing that you think is wrong, again? It&#x27;s when you can
relate to a person, their experiences, their thoughts because you feel like
they&#x27;d understand what you feel and what you go through things. You fall in love
with the hope of being understood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love the part of yourself in them.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said. &lt;strong&gt;You can&#x27;t understand other people&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and when you think that
you finally found someone whom you think you understand, you love them. When
you understand what makes them happy or what hurts them. [&lt;em&gt;This again feels like
loving what you can predict because you can only predict what you understand.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love what you understand.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe my version of love is selfish. Maybe it&#x27;s not good to expect anything
from the people you love. But then again, if love was about comfort, why would
it take a lot of effort? Why would someone show effort to show love? Why would
it come with the responsibility toward them? Why would loving someone hurt?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love what loves you back.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to loving a part of yourself in them, you love the part of them you
wish you had in yourself. You love what you think would complete you. You
love...[&lt;em&gt;This is stopping to make sense the more I write, but I&#x27;ll keep
writing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love what you want as your own.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I talked a lot about &quot;you&quot; now let me talk about &quot;me&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love yourself.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing that I hate the most is the fear of losing what I love. And the
constant reminder of the fact that you&#x27;ll always lose the one you love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You hate what you can&#x27;t have.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love shiny new things&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but, shiny things doesn&#x27;t remain new forever and
not all new things remain shiny forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really didn&#x27;t want to conclude this but, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can only love what you can
respect&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when you don&#x27;t have to compromise&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on what you choose to
respect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You love when you choose to love.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Fake Intelligence</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:40:24 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/fake-intelligence/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/fake-intelligence/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/fake-intelligence/">&lt;p&gt;I realize that I had a personality that revolved around being smart. That I
was able to learn things fast and didn&#x27;t need to make much effort to learn
things or get &quot;good&quot; grades. I mean, it is a good thing to praise someone&#x27;s
ability to grasp things easily, but, when the same thing is validated by the
teachers, the family and everyone else—it doesn&#x27;t take long to believe that
you are special, and you can do what nobody can do. Understand everything with
little to no efforts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basing your personality on being smart will only push you back. [&lt;em&gt;Few months to
whole years.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]  That is, until you realize that it wasn&#x27;t the correct thing to
base a personality on. When I didn&#x27;t get the things on one go, I neglected it by
saying that I wasn&#x27;t focused that time, promised to look at it again and never
looked back with the fear that I might not get it in one go. [&lt;em&gt;I am studying
engineering, not that easy to understand on one go.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only took part in things I already knew and ignored everything else that I
didn&#x27;t know. That is how I managed to fail most of the semesters of my
engineering degree, I wouldn&#x27;t read the books because failing by not reading
was much easier than failing by trying. [&lt;em&gt;I could say to myself, &quot;If I had
read I would have passed, it is just because I chose to not read.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Yeah, I
sounded that stupid. [&lt;em&gt;It was a threat to my own identity; I was supposed to be
smart, why was I struggling.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would avoid difficulty instead of leaning into it and learning from it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking that I was better than other people, I would not respect the ones who
studied day and night to pass. I would say, I could understand things once I
read it, they need to grind. This is how toxic one could get when the whole
personality is based on one thing, &quot;being intelligent&#x2F;smart.&quot; [&lt;em&gt;I think
&quot;Inside Out: 2&quot; touches on this concept very well.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only realized that it needs hard work at the end of my bachelor year, while
failing most previous ones. One day or another it needed to happen, It is almost
too late, but I should be thankful to myself for not letting it go further. I
still don&#x27;t want to fail [&lt;em&gt;Who Does?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], but if I fail, I will know why instead
of it being my arrogance of being &quot;intelligent,  which I am not.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have protected my identity of being a smart kid for so long, I am not a kid
anymore and I don&#x27;t care for being smart anymore. [&lt;em&gt;At least not that kind of
smart.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] While everyone was struggling and learning about things, I was locked
inside my comfort zone. I am no longer wearing a mask of fake intelligence now,
I am struggling, and it&#x27;s a good thing. I hope others like me realize this soon
enough. That is also a reason why I am writing this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you get praised for being smart, what people are actually praising is
effortless success, not hard work. This needs to change.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Novelty</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 23:10:38 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/novelty/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/novelty/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/novelty/">&lt;p&gt;I love showing off the things that I have made. There is rarely anything novel
about the things that I make, it mostly comprises Frankensteined pieces of
different people&#x27;s works of art. It is almost always something that is inspired
from someone. But I adore the things that I make because I pieced them together
myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love seeing people use and love the things that I pieced together, It
makes me want to make more things. [&lt;em&gt;I do tend to force some of my dearest
peers to use the things that I make, just so they can appreciate them
afterwards.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I like spoon-feeding throughout the process of setting things up
too. [&lt;em&gt;Even if it is not something made by me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since the things I make contain the bits and pieces of other people&#x27;s work
and also because I love open source I let people see how it is made and want
people to fork off of my work to make their own version too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I want uniqueness too. Ever since I have known about the word, I have
wanted to be unique. It&#x27;s the reason I started using Linux, the reason I
opened a GitLab account instead of GitHub. [&lt;em&gt;Though I use GitHub too now.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
I almost always used the things that the masses didn&#x27;t use. I loved the concept
of making things myself that I joined engineering. And since the magic box is
all that is needed to create new things myself, I joined computer engineering.
Unlike civil or architectural engineering or any other engineering where I
would need more and more resources as I made things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to novelty, I love adding at least one simple unique twist that is
from my own brain. [&lt;em&gt;Though it might have been inspired from someone else
subconsciously.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Though everything is a Frankenstein of other people&#x27;s art. I
give a heart to the Frankenstein body, myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Someday, I wish I will create something entirely with all my ideas.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;That day, you&#x27;ll know about it because I will probably be pushing it down
your throat. (With Love, dear reader.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Please don&#x27;t mind it, okay? :D&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Anything you Want</title>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/anything-you-want/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/anything-you-want/">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;If someone proves that something you believe is wrong is not only possible but
also accepted by those around you, to the point that it makes you question
yourself and lose confidence in your own judgment, does that invalidate your
judgment?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you fine with doing the gray things if someone else is doing it too?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything will be validated to you if you ask in the right place. If you want
killing animals to be a good thing, you ask a butcher how he is feeding his
family. [&lt;em&gt;Or ask yourself if you aren&#x27;t a vegetarian.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
If you want killing animals to be a bad thing, ask someone who has turned vegan.
[&lt;em&gt;Or just anyone without the context.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But, what do you think? What conclusion
do you reach from your own biases [&lt;em&gt;unbiased (externally)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] with your own
experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it automatically become a right thing to do if someone else does it?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people can be wrong too. If your gut tells you it&#x27;s bad, it has a reason
to feel that way. But, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you are correct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the questions that validates you no matter what, is the best way to be
validated. You can just search &quot;Why is it good to kill animals?&quot; and you will
get a million reasons why it is fine. And you will get a million reason for why
it isn&#x27;t fine if you ask why it is bad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this because I wanted to charge my phone with my laptop&#x27;s charger
which felt like it isn&#x27;t good, but I searched &quot;Why is it fine to charge a phone
with a laptop&#x27;s charger?&quot; to calm myself down to do the thing anyway.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me think how arrogant I can be in things I believe to be &quot;the right
thing&quot; or &quot;the right way&quot;. I mean, using Facebook is not good (because privacy)
using windows is not good (because privacy) and I do stand by it because
I have collected the experiences to say that it is bad. But saying the same
because some guy said it to me, or I read something about it, is like saying
Pineapple on pizza is good (or bad) without even tasting it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure there is a name for this phenomenon. [&lt;em&gt;I&#x27;ll ask ChatGPT about it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
But I just can&#x27;t believe the internet, and I can&#x27;t believe the people around
me. But is it because I don&#x27;t want to be wrong? I spend my time trying not to
be wrong, gathering the most optimal and the best of the best things to add
to my personality. Is not wanting to be wrong taking away my precious time
then being wrong a few times. Is it really worth it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you doing the same? Because &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;anything you want&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to be true is true if
you ask it in the right place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;If optimizing something takes too long, is it worth optimizing? Because what&#x27;s
the point? \o&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;BTW, I asked ChatGPT, it said: &lt;strong&gt;confirmation bias&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;motivated reasoning&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;echo chamber effect&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Trying out Orgmode</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 22:40:22 +0545</pubDate>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/trying-out-orgmode/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/trying-out-orgmode/">&lt;p&gt;Org mode is one of the &quot;modes&quot; in Emacs. [&lt;em&gt;Could be the most lazy
Definition of org-mode till date.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] So, what exactly is orgmode?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s start with &quot;Org&quot;. Org is a markup language like Markdown.
[&lt;em&gt;Could be the most lazy definition of org-mode till date.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Is it a plain text system of writing documents? I can&#x27;t exactly
describe it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;orgmode.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Org is a highly flexible structured plain text file format,
composed of a few simple, yet versatile, structures — constructed
to be both simple enough for the novice and powerful enough for
the expert.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it is a way to take notes, make to-dos and agendas, and organize your
thoughts, control your whole life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while or is a &quot;typeset,&quot; org-mode is the controlling environment.
For that very typeset. Meaning, org-mode controls the org documents.
One way to demonstrate is by making tables in org. [&lt;em&gt;BTW, you can do
row&#x2F;columnwise operations in org tables, like in a spreadsheet.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t write anything because there are way too many things that org
cand do. [&lt;em&gt;Ironically, I&#x27;m writing this blog in markdown.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have set org-roam up so that I can ditch Obsidian. [&lt;em&gt;The main
problem is that I have stopped taking notes (somehow).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;And now
I have found the most beautiful of notebooks that I just want to
make use of it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;That&#x27;s what I feel about orgmode.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I scoured the whole internet and didn&#x27;t find a single GIF of
orgmode tables in action. --&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cxoE2FhOIgI?si=_VmywiLBej4AdJML&amp;amp;t=261&quot;&gt;demo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Evil</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 16:15:23 +0545</pubDate>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/evil/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/evil/">&lt;p&gt;So, I am using emacs now. And for a long time vim user, I am very evil.
My whole life has become an evil mess. I have exam &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;tomorrow&quot;&gt;tomorrow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and I am
configuring emacs with my heart&#x27;s content. Should get back to work now. I don&#x27;t want
to fail the exam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want this to remain an experiment because I am loving emacs, but it feels ever so
slightly sluggish than (neo)vim so, lets see. Also I have set up org and org-roam so, hopefully
I let emacs control my life instead of obsidian now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; This text is written inside emacs. (In markdown mode.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;You get a mode, I get a mode, Everyone, Everybody, Everything get&#x27;s a mode.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Not in Control</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 18:08:44 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/not-in-control/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/not-in-control/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/not-in-control/">&lt;p&gt;There are too many things we cannot control. [&lt;em&gt;I wish I could go back in time and fix things.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Controlling yourself is hard enough, I wonder how difficult would be controlling &quot;time&quot;.
I didn&#x27;t decide to write this thinking I couldn&#x27;t control time. [&lt;em&gt;Actually I had put this
topic on &quot;things to write about&quot; yesterday, and today I don&#x27;t remember what inspired me to put
that there. Regardless, I am writing about it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Apparently I cannot control what I want to remember.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the fact that I learned something yesterday which I don&#x27;t remember today haunts me.
I guess I will remember what I learned when the situation asks for it. Anyway, I would
love for things to be on my control. [&lt;em&gt;I guess that&#x27;s what &quot;power&quot; is.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I think every
one likes to have things in their control.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But, instead of controlling others or things,
the best thing one can do is fully control themselves. [&lt;em&gt;Which nobody can.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I can&#x27;t even
control a fraction of myself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling yourself boils down to laziness and habits. And I have a very bad habit of being
lazy and letting things out of control. The more I try to control myself over doing things
(my bad habits) [&lt;em&gt;No, I don&#x27;t smoke. But, it&#x27;s worse than that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] it pulls me too hard that I
go back to it. [&lt;em&gt;I cheat myself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] It&#x27;s wishing to reach a destination and making no efforts
towards it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things I want to control is what I say to people. [&lt;em&gt;I want to control my privacy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Though
I know that everything I speak can be used against me. I share things, I vent things out of control.
Almost to people who wouldn&#x27;t care to listen or worse who don&#x27;t care about me. [&lt;em&gt;Best thing that can
happen when venting is that they remember nothing about it, but you feel good telling it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Writing about things help me have second and third thoughts before I actually say something.
For someone who knows so much about privacy on the internet and uses signal, I am a fraud for
being what I am in real life. [&lt;em&gt;Like, I regret saying some things to some people, which thankfully
haven&#x27;t been used against me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I am controlling it fairly well these days.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say I won&#x27;t eat junk today, and I end up eating fast food. I say I will wake up early and end up skipping
the alarm and waking up at 9. I say I&#x27;ll miss out on things and end up using &quot;the social media&quot; for
far too long. Controlling myself to do things I want to do has been difficult. I don&#x27;t expect exerting
power and control over others. [&lt;em&gt;One thing I can somewhat control is my computer. And I am studying to
be able to do it more.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not in my own control.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;But, I realize, slowly is the way to go.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Fully controlling myself and my computer, &lt;strong&gt;that&#x27;s the dream.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>In a Limit</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 18:07:49 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/in-a-limit/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/in-a-limit/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/in-a-limit/">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Yeah, you know it, I know it, we know it but, we always want a little more.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving that extra effort, making that extra move, going that extra mile is fine [&lt;em&gt;(I know I am completely contradicting the title.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] but only do it if you are doing it once. The efforts you
put should only scale upwards with time. [&lt;em&gt;Reality is often disappointing, and it normally goes
down.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, why am I writing this? [&lt;em&gt;Such a nice way to increase the word count.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I ate a little too
much yesterday, and well if you give me the same thing I ate yesterday, I don&#x27;t think I can look
at it, let alone eat it. Most of the time we don&#x27;t know what the limit it, what our limit is.
[&lt;em&gt;Not saying that we let that limit be the final limit, but there will always be a limit&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time, huh? We all wish that. [&lt;em&gt;let&#x27;s not generalize, most of
us wish that.*&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And we just cannot, for the sake of science, know the right time or the right
thing. [&lt;em&gt;No, it&#x27;s not a theory developed by Heisenberg.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I feel like I am talking to myself more
than writing this haha.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you try to do too much, you compensate it by doing too less the next time. [&lt;em&gt;How do I know?
I didn&#x27;t use social media for 3 days and spent 13 hours on YouTube and shorts yesterday. (The data speaks.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Perfectly balancing the things is the best thing to do. [&lt;em&gt;Yeah, you heard that correct,
Thanos was right.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Slowly, I am being more dependent on AI to do things, and I don&#x27;t like it.
Yeah, not using AI will surely push you backward, but the right way is to limit the usage.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is good when you don&#x27;t limit it. You should eat in a limit, sleep in a limit, love in a
limit and yes also hate in a limit. Drink too much water, and it&#x27;s bad, drink too less and it&#x27;s bad.
[&lt;em&gt;Yeah, I know, I thought the same, I thought what could water do to harm you?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Forget water,
if you somehow got too much oxygen you&#x27;ll die, and you probably know what&#x27;ll happen when you get
to little.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep too little, that&#x27;s bad, sleep too much, that&#x27;s bad as well. Exercise too little, that&#x27;s
bad, Exercise too much, that&#x27;s bad as well. I can go on and on with each task on your routine and
it&#x27;ll always be true. [&lt;em&gt;I guess knowing too much isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, everything in life remains good if you do it in a limit. Not too little not too much, you should be just right but not only on one thing, on everything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I take that back, knowing too much isn&#x27;t god either, I don&#x27;t want to know if the girl I like,
but can&#x27;t talk to, doesn&#x27;t like me. (I would like the state of my mind when I didn&#x27;t know about it.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Also, the above line is totally fictional, I don&#x27;t know if she doesn&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;The above line isn&#x27;t true, either. I don&#x27;t have someone I like but can&#x27;t talk to.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Haha, it&#x27;s &quot;not true&quot; all the way down until you reach the turtles.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only thing that is above and is true, is that too much or too less of anything is bad.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>God, Bhajan and Shower Thoughts</title>

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/god-bhajan-and-shower-thoughts/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t have an audience, let alone international ones, but &#x27;bhajans&#x27; are hindu songs about god.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely talk about god. [&lt;em&gt;Except for when I am defending about it not existing.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
But, the fact that so many people believe in something without no proof at all also
makes sense. [&lt;em&gt;No, I don&#x27;t see me turning into a theist anytime soon.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] People can
just blame the all-powerful, almighty [&lt;em&gt;alknowledged?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] for their mistakes.
[&lt;em&gt;Now, that&#x27;s an oxymoron.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Still, they do it because it calms them down.
[&lt;em&gt;Well, &quot;god&quot; isn&#x27;t defending themselves for what they are accused of.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Yeah! People don&#x27;t just blame god, they believe in them. They worship
them, they fear them, they wish to them, they rely on them. [&lt;em&gt;Someone who
feels like god is in their side will be more confident and energetic.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
But, In a sense, that is a good thing. How I understand it, that &quot;god&quot; is a
void where they can pour all their feelings at. [&lt;em&gt;God won&#x27;t judge them feelings.
(How would they? First, they need to exist. XD)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought came to me this morning when I was bathing [&lt;em&gt;shower thoughts, huh?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and my
dad had put bhajans on the TV. [&lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t think my dad believes in &quot;god&quot;, he just plays
along. Or, at least he makes it seem like he doesn&#x27;t care.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But something about the bhajans
just felt like nothing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, hear me out, I was listening to the bhajans while bathing and those didn&#x27;t invoke
any feelings in me. It didn&#x27;t have sorrow, or happiness, or greed .... nothing. It was
just words being sung about something that didn&#x27;t exist, the voice didn&#x27;t have to be soothing,
the words didn&#x27;t have to mean something. [&lt;em&gt;For me as an atheist at least.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I know there are
praises and good things about god being told but when I put god out of the equation, it&#x27;s
words that feel good but doesn&#x27;t contain bias. [&lt;em&gt;I heard bhajans because it&#x27;s a Hindu household
but it could have been anything sung for&#x2F;about god, and it would just be praises and wishes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
It&#x27;s like listening to music [&lt;em&gt;(not songs)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], it means nothing but feels good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in reincarnations or magic or &quot;something only god does and can do but has never done&quot;. But from the
social aspect of it, I think it&#x27;s fine to be a theist. [&lt;em&gt;Which I didn&#x27;t think previously (they&#x27;re stoopid).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
If you were told from birth that something feels good when it is done, and are constantly fed that
information, you&#x27;d develop a &quot;feel good&quot; response to that information even when it&#x27;s not being &quot;fed&quot;
to you. [&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Conditioning&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, as a belief, can be the antidote to existential crisis, and a hope to hold on to. The confirmation
bias aspect of it reinforces the feeling. If you wish for god to give you something that&#x27;ll make you
happy at least once a day, you will confirm it when you are happy and conclude that god exists. Well,
god didn&#x27;t have to exist if there was no sorrow, no pain, no &quot;all the bad things that can happen&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t believe in something that is so unscientific, but at the same time the psychological aspect
of &quot;god&quot; has made it a good enough thing to keep existing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t want to be lazy and wish for god to do it for me. But maybe it&#x27;s the youth in me speaking,
I can justify not being able to do anything and believing in god. (It can be healthy in ways.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I really did not think that I would reach such a conclusion, writing things out just fires up those
passive neurons. What can I say, \o&#x2F; My brain&#x27;s a thinker.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (and also a thinkerer. XD)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Void Bed</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:59:57 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/void-bed/">&lt;p&gt;My bed is one of the deepest place in the world. [&lt;em&gt;for me&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] If I sit on it
I sink. If I lie on it, I sleep. If I sleep on it, I dream. [&lt;em&gt;If I dream on it
I forget what I had to do.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to ignore it, I sit on the floor, I stand up and work, I sit on the table.
[&lt;em&gt;On the chair, I mean.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But it just pulls me. Like it is a black-hole that&#x27;s
just for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want to sleep at the daytime. But, if it just sits on it, I cannot help
myself to not lie on it and the cycle repeats. Changing the properties of the bed
doesn&#x27;t work. I keep books, my sitting table, bags and everything on the bed, just
so I don&#x27;t sleep on it on daytime. [&lt;em&gt;But I am lazy enough to just lie on the smallest
remaining portion of it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, now that my &quot;brain&quot; thinks about it, it&#x27;s not &quot;Void Bed&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Void Brain&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Aaah... I have blamed my brain too many times, one of these days I&#x27;ll achieve a praise for it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Void Brainiac&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Give and Take (Receive) </title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 21:54:24 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/give-and-take/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/give-and-take/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/give-and-take/">&lt;p&gt;I see many people expecting something in return when they do something
for someone. Returning a favor. Owing one. All these things are there as
a norm. Sometimes people expect something to be done out of love. [&lt;em&gt;or I have
to do it because I am someone to them. (like your relatives expecting a call
once in a while.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Humans have made giving and taking as inseparable parts of
a single process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, you should return something you
owe to someone. I am not against that. Taking and not giving back is practically
stealing. But, it doesn&#x27;t always have to be a single process. Socially, I feel like
making things obvious that you did something and telling them that they have to repay
it somehow is awkward. [&lt;em&gt;I am going all over the place with this text.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Well, look at open source developers, they get paid in respect (unknowingly) and hate; when it comes to hate (very
verbally). If they were paid back for what they did for you(Everyone), they would be too happy and also rich.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, there are some things that you just give and some things that you just take. [&lt;em&gt;Two&#x2F;From
two different people.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Like advices, if you are given an advice, you don&#x27;t owe an advice to them.
I don&#x27;t have problems with exchange of things. But being entitled and expecting something
from someone is what I don&#x27;t like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other thing is people being generous and giving a lot for a little thing they did and
making people think like they owe them back now instead. [&lt;em&gt;I think you&#x27;ll understand whom I am
referring with each they&#x2F;them.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making promises for a favor is another. [&lt;em&gt;I will be able to do something for you in the future
if you give something now.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I can trust the people I am close to on this. But, strangers? [&lt;em&gt;Asking
for vote, huh?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where am I going with this?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#x27;t want to feel like I owe someone something and someone owes me something.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#x27;t expect something in return for some help, don&#x27;t keep mentioning it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can only help if I can and also if I want to. [&lt;em&gt;I normally do.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&#x27;t trust someone I don&#x27;t trust and is unreliable. [&lt;em&gt;Takes twice to know.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something I deserve I will get it and if it is something you deserve you&#x27;ll too.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I put myself in other person&#x27;s place and think for once. [&lt;em&gt;You should too, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really finally, I won&#x27;t ask for something I think I am not qualified for or I don&#x27;t know about just for my profit in it. [&lt;em&gt;That&#x27;s something you earn, and you can&#x27;t get it by  asking for it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;em&gt;There may be more that I forgot to write while writing this.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[&lt;em&gt;In other words: etc.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Best of Luck XD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered this while writing this so here you go; this is how giving and receiving should feel like: [&lt;em&gt;:D&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&quot;We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.&quot; &quot;It is a love based on giving and receiving as well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving, we too can share and love and have and receive.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Legacy Fonts are Pain</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 23:30:45 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/legacy-fonts-are-pain/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/legacy-fonts-are-pain/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/legacy-fonts-are-pain/">&lt;p&gt;Since there is support for almost all characters in Unicode, all devices have been
able to render all kinds of characters. Characters ranging from Indic to Korean,
Kanji, Chinese... you name it. Today it is all smooth sailing, if it is written in
Unicode it works everywhere, hence, UNICODE.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if your language uses non-English characters and your government [&lt;em&gt;&quot;Everyone&quot; I mean.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] used to use fonts that just
changed those English characters to your language and everyone [&lt;em&gt;Mostly old people.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
knew that font to be the main way to write in that language. You now are in trouble.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those fonts had to be installed and setup so that if they are used they displayed properly.
Because the &quot;characters&quot; that you see are not understood universally be all computers. Only
the computer with your &quot;font&quot; installed will be able to show the characters you intended to write
otherwise, it will fall back to English.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the famous &quot;legacy fonts&quot; is &lt;em&gt;Preeti&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. It is considered to be THE NEPALI FONT by
almost all [&lt;em&gt;old&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] people. So, they use it to write documents and make presentations and
everything they need to do in Nepali. And now, when it reaches to someone else&#x27;s computer [&lt;em&gt;(With no Preeti installed.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;],
you know what happens. [&lt;em&gt;All you see is English gibberish.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] The [&lt;em&gt;old&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] people will consider
that their pen-drive is corrupted or computer has virus and proceed to buy an antivirus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate dealing with these kinds of fonts. And installing custom fonts on NixOS is almost a
pain. [&lt;em&gt;Unless you have already done it once.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And the fact that it won&#x27;t work universally
means that even if you install &lt;em&gt;Preeti&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; on your device, when you send it to someone else
it just won&#x27;t work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to boo the people if you see them using these kinds of fonts in this day and age.
Tell them to use an Unicode font that supports their language. &lt;strong&gt;Noto&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; being an example.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;And lastly, I just hate dealing with Preeti. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Unknown Sustaining Pairs</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 20:56:25 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/unknown-sustaining-pairs/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/unknown-sustaining-pairs/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/unknown-sustaining-pairs/">&lt;p&gt;This morning, I realized that the bag&#x2F;sack of rice that is kind of a waste
product when buying rice, works as a garbage collecting bag for the month
which is tied and sent to the garbage truck. [&lt;em&gt;I never remember buying a sack
for the garbage, it&#x27;s always there.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] That got me thinking about
if there are other such things that I don&#x27;t know. [&lt;em&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but
I didn&#x27;t find any other. (Or, didn&#x27;t think hard enough.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But It got me thinking for sure. Got me thinking about relationships, symbiotes,
and what not. And since I am so fascinated by how humans behave the way they
behave. [&lt;em&gt;I am a human too. &lt;strong&gt;Or, am I?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I realized that in a relationship
[&lt;em&gt;Defined as having a mutual exchange of daily time and efforts. (Defined by myself
don&#x27;t go looking for this definition on the internet.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] we miss many things
that we take for granted because they just happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;No, the clothes don&#x27;t magically wash and dry themselves when you put them in the
basket. Your mom did that for you. (It isn&#x27;t magic.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was saying, we only know the importance of things when we suddenly don&#x27;t have
it. When it doesn&#x27;t exist and things goes sideways, you then realize its
importance. [&lt;em&gt;this is getting monotonous, the TL;DR is that I thought about
different things just because I realized that some things just sustain
themselves unknowingly.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Encounters</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 19:39:34 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/encounters/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/encounters/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/encounters/">&lt;p&gt;I want to forget the things I want to forget. I want to move on and think
about things, I actually want to think about. Ideally, I would want to wipe
my memory of some things while still keeping the things that I learnt from
it. But, this is the defence mechanism of the brain, it is how it works and
how it tries to save us, warn us about making the same mistakes or decisions
again. Though the memories are unpleasant, it keeps us alive. And I really don&#x27;t
want to make more mistakes. [&lt;em&gt;(again)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I do consciously know the lessons I have learnt, [&lt;em&gt;without feeling the fear&#x2F;pain.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
the memories just bombards me with a daisy chain of more memories and hence more and more emotions
about things. And those memories occur the most when you encounter the things
that caused you harm. Encounters when you&#x27;re minding your own business, when
having fun when being calm, just shatter the current state of mind and I hate it
when it happens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, to seem like an alpha, the strong one, the one who is stable and able
to face challenges, anti-forces, dangers, a human being learns from the mistakes and
faces it in new ways. I don&#x27;t think I will complete give up on some concepts just
because I have faced challenges and obstacles when learning about it. But when these
memories of fear and harm come to you, to move on, I think you should just ignore them
to make them a minor forgettable thing but still keeping the things you have learned
from and made mistakes in mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time I encounter things, I would want them to make no difference on my day
but only when trying out the thing that I had failed in, the precautions of experiences
should help. [&lt;em&gt;Ideally&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think it&#x27;s true about what they say.
[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Pain; No Gain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Happy π day, everyone. Something that is as simple as a circle gave us π which is
infinite and never ending, yet nobody exactly knows it&#x27;s value. You will
never be correct on what π is. And that&#x27;s how I see life, you will never know enough about it,
it&#x27;s just &lt;strong&gt;learn, adapt, act, repeat&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; till you achieve your infinity.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Crying when Movies End</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:44:13 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/crying-when-movies-end/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/crying-when-movies-end/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/crying-when-movies-end/">&lt;p&gt;This will probably sound weird but, I cry (almost) 80% of the times when a
movie ends. If not, at least once throughout the movie. [&lt;em&gt;And it is not like
I watch emotional movies, I do watch psychological thrillers, or just thrillers
in general too, but mostly comedy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I sometimes think that my eyes are the problem, due to continuous
focus on a single place [&lt;em&gt;screen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. But, It never happens when I generally scroll, or watch
YouTube videos for hours.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do feel things, but not immediately, I need some time to process things to feel
what they should feel like. I feel like I have developed a response to it such that
whenever it is supposed to feel &quot;an emotion&quot; I feel it. And when it is something new
and I can&#x27;t react. I will eventually feel it when I gather enough information on how too
feel about something. [&lt;em&gt;This means I can&#x27;t be emotionally manipulated (Unless you already
know how I&#x27;ll react to something.), but I can be manipulated to act emotionally.
(understand what I mean?)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been told by my parents and also my relatives that I am a robot. [&lt;em&gt;They mean,
I act like one. &lt;strong&gt;Or do they?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I do things exactly as they are told to me and won&#x27;t think
about something else that can be done while doing the thing I am tasked with. I feel the same
about my emotions, too. If I know that something should make me happy, I get happy. It&#x27;s almost
an algorithm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I know how I should feel, I feel it. [&lt;em&gt;or, I try to feel it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something new, I look toward my friends and react according to how they feel.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something new and my friends aren&#x27;t around, I react according to the surrounding majority.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something new and my friends aren&#x27;t around I can&#x27;t figure out what to feel, I don&#x27;t feel
anything until, I think about it, research about it, find out what is wrong and what is right, then
I start feeling the way I needed to feel.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am alone, and I am watching a movie, I just decide if the scene is supposed to be happy or sad And
I start laughing out or crying accordingly. [&lt;em&gt;It happens so naturally that I just can&#x27;t help it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crying at a horror movie because the ghost had died and though it had killed a lot of people, you know that
that ghost was once a person with a family, had a life, went through tragedies and something made it be evil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or crying when the hero finally gets the girl and crying again when they break up. [&lt;em&gt;Yeah! It&#x27;s not just the
sad moments I cry in, I do it in happy moments too.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Like, in Shashank Redemption when he escapes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally prefer to watch comedies because of this. I just can&#x27;t watch movies that depict a lot of emotions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;When I watched Inside Out and Inside Out 2 it was an awful experience, I had tears in my eyes all the time. (I love the movie.) But,
I just hate it because I cried when joy got angry, and when sadness was happy and when anger was calm and thoughtful, it was all over the place.
I like that about the movie, but the entire movie was about feelings feeling feelings that I was all tears throughout the blurred movie.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&quot;You just feel things, it&#x27;s not like you think and feel.&quot; one might say. But, I don&#x27;t (haven&#x27;t&#x2F;didn&#x27;t) cry when things break,
people pass away, friends go away, someone I love leaves; Because I know that I should not feel things, that I should be &quot;strong&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reasons led me to science because they are only facts, and I don&#x27;t have to decide on what to feel, think or say because
in science things are clear (mostly) and what it is supposed to be can be determined by how it&#x27;s properties are defined (with the general truths).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;hmmmmmm, science; almost a cult, eh? But, it&#x27;s easier than acting human, I prefer being like a robot. :D&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Continuous: Oxidation</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 22:33:37 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/continuous-oxidation/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/continuous-oxidation/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/continuous-oxidation/">&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time this has happened. I am trying to replace all the programs I use
to the ones written in rust. Why? You might ask. [&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s for fun!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I get to rice new things.
Rust is a cool kid language, but unlike other cool kids it&#x27;s a sophisticated one too. So, it&#x27;s
no doubt that it&#x27;s going to rule the world, maybe not for the next 100 years, but I could bet 50.
Now, let&#x27;s come straight to the programs I used to use and the ones I have replaced with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;hyprland-with-niri&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x27;hyprland&#x27; with &#x27;niri&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike hyprland niri is not exactly a tiling window manager but a scrolling one. It&#x27;s a cool
concept where my existing window&#x27;s don&#x27;t get resized when I open a new one, it just adds itself
to it&#x27;s side like a photo reel. [&lt;em&gt;No, not instagram.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;waybar-with-way-edges&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x27;waybar&#x27; with &#x27;way-edges&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;way-edges is not a bar but it can act like one and since I like no distractions on my workspace
they[&lt;em&gt;(It has multiple widgets.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] hide automatically and show up on hover. I just love it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ghostty-with-alacritty&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x27;ghostty&#x27; with &#x27;alacritty&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a step-down because ghostty is feature rich whereas alacritty is minimal. Let&#x27;s see
how this one goes. I rarely use the image rendering feature and alacritty does great with everything text.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zsh-with-nushell&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x27;zsh&#x27; with &#x27;nushell&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two shells to choose from, one was fish and another was nu, I went with the cool kid in the block but
let&#x27;s see how it holds up. It feels more stable and super intuiative than I last tried it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;fzf-with-skim&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x27;fzf&#x27; with &#x27;skim&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used fzf but skim was almost a drop in replacement for it. I say &quot;almost&quot; because some arguments that fzf
supported didn&#x27;t work on skim. [&lt;em&gt;Well, they were cosmetic arguments so who cares.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;now-we-are-heading-deeper-into-the-iceberg&quot;&gt;Now we are heading Deeper into the Iceberg&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;grep&#x27; with &#x27;ripgrep&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ripgrep&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is just faster than &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;ls&#x27; with &#x27;eza&#x2F;nu&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;I do have &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as a fallback shell, and I would use &lt;code&gt;eza&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; there, otherwise &lt;code&gt;nu&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; handles &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;   like a charm.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;cd&#x27; with &#x27;zoxide&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Instead of walking through the dirs using &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; I jump straight to where I want with &lt;code&gt;zoxide&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;cat&#x27; with &#x27;bat&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Conbatination? Haha, it syntax highlights too.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;find&#x27; with &#x27;fd&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;What is there &quot;in&quot; &lt;code&gt;fd&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; that isn&#x27;t there &lt;code&gt;in&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; find.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;magic-wormhole&#x27; with &#x27;magic-wormhole-rs&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;I am lying, I used the rs version all along.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;top&#x2F;htop&#x27; with &#x27;bottom&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;It just looks cool.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;dunst&#x27; with &#x27;swayOSD&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Dunst wasn&#x27;t meant to be used as an OSD.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;trash-cli&#x27; with &#x27;trashy&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;Well, I&#x27;ll let my trash rust in the bin.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;2025-03-13&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x27;carapace&#x27; with &#x27;fish&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; : &lt;em&gt;I love nushell and I like fish completions, why not Frankenstein this shit, right?.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;Also, Fish has been rewritten in rust XD.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;2025-03-17&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

          <title>How Engineers get High *without* Drugs</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 20:58:21 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/how-engineers-get-high-without-drugs/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/how-engineers-get-high-without-drugs/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/how-engineers-get-high-without-drugs/">&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I really don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to be high. So, this is for what I
consider high. To be in a state where you feel nothing but extreme joy and you
forget everything else. [&lt;em&gt;So, now that we have my definition of high. Let&#x27;s start
talking.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need a friend. [&lt;em&gt;One that understand the words coming out of your mouth.
(hehe, Rush Hour)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] You need something that you [&lt;em&gt;both&#x2F;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] are working on.
So, when you are researching on something and it fascinates you and your friends at
the same time, consider the process started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel joy about the topic you are trying to learn about. And when everything
that you are thinking ahead of time and are predicting, matches with what you are learning
about. You&#x27;ll feel it. With joy, you&#x27;ll start laughing and you laughing triggers your friend
laughing and your friend laughing triggers you laughing back and the process continues.
[&lt;em&gt;In engineering term, A feedback loop.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers get high when the thing they are working on actually works. [&lt;em&gt;By works, I mean remotely
moves at all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] When what they know matches with what they are trying to do. When, you and your
friend both understand what&#x27;s going on and how to go ahead. [&lt;em&gt;Sorta like, &quot;Are you thinking what I
am thinking?&quot;, and it&#x27;s almost the same every time.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] We get high when brainstorming and it&#x27;s actually
storming.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Trying out obscure things and making them work the way you want &lt;strong&gt;(sometimes just on your head)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
(and seeing it work the way you wanted, when you think it shouldn&#x27;t have), that&#x27;s how to get high as engineers.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Why Feminism needs a Rebrand</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:51:47 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/why-feminism-needs-a-rebrand/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/why-feminism-needs-a-rebrand/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/why-feminism-needs-a-rebrand/">&lt;p&gt;I mean this in the sincerest way possible. I have much respect for what Feminism represents
and I don&#x27;t mean any disrespect toward the current as well as historical significance of
feminism. [&lt;em&gt;It is a very sensitive topic and I wouldn&#x27;t have had to clarify that these are my views if it were
a bit easier to talk about.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And it has been a difficult topic to talk about just because I am a
man and this society has some bias [&lt;em&gt;and prejudice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] towards men talking about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Feminism&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Feminism is a range of socio-political movements and ideologies that aim to define and establish
the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism holds the position
that modern societies are patriarchal—they prioritize the male point of view—and that women are
treated unjustly in these societies. Efforts to change this include fighting against gender stereotypes
and improving educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who actually researches on the topic to understand what a word represents, [&lt;em&gt;Don&#x27;t take that looking at
the wikipedia is research from this, it isn&#x27;t, it in an ideal condition represents what the mass has agreeed on.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
the definition gives a pretty clear view for what feminism actually stands for. But, not everyone is like that, people
normally understand words by their composition. For example, when I found out that the beautiful dotted
red bug was called a ladybug, I thought it to be a female bug of that species, but ladybugs despite
their name represents both the female and the male bugs. [&lt;em&gt;Some people might have not known about this
fact, well, who cares about the gender of a bug, right? (except biologists ofcourse).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Hence, confusing ladybug with only the female bug isn&#x27;t much of a problem.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the same logic, breaking feminism we get; fem-(in):  Relating to women or the female gender, and -ism: Denoting
a belief system or ideology. Though, this doesn&#x27;t seem as problematic. At face value, feminism would be interpreted
as &quot;women&#x27;s system&quot; [&lt;em&gt;Rule of women.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] which it isn&#x27;t. Though it was to uplift the women in the patriarchal society
and it mostly represented for the equal rights for women, it by no means is only related to women in today&#x27;s context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I won&#x27;t argue against saying, &quot;It&#x27;s about women, why does everything have to about you for you to care.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any rebrand is done to match the context of the present time, it represents evolution and positive growth. Sticking
to the roots is good but for such a sensitive topic [&lt;em&gt;(Which should not have been sensitive, because everyone should
have understood its significance by now.)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] it cannot [&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shouldn&#x27;t&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] be interpreted wrongly. It might be justified
by the wording which goes something on the lines of &lt;code&gt;Equalism&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Equityism&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; emphasizing equality and equity for all
people despite their diverseness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a male, I advocate about feminism in my own ways and efforts but in a male dominated society  and from my own
Experiences it would be much easier to convey the message and make people understand by representing the cause as
a neutral effort rather than something solely for women and by women, as the term &#x27;feminism&#x27; might suggest.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Because, we humans are selfish by nature and are more likely to accept the cause if it is personal to us. On the
other hand, we reject it if it even remotely is against us. &lt;strong&gt;(Cognitive Dissonance one might say.)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself am not against it, someone who is well-educated would not be against feminism for the same reasons as I am. With
enough context, anyone would say that it is foolish to be against feminism. A rational* person (not just man) would be foolish
if they didn&#x27;t consider themselves a feminist, because it makes no sense to not accept, let alone reject being one. And
if someone doesn&#x27;t like the concept of feminism it is because they don&#x27;t understand it, it has been misrepresented to them
or they actually don&#x27;t want anyone other than &quot;their own kind&quot; to have the privilege that they have.
[&lt;em&gt;Which is fundamentally unjust and inhumane, and we all know and understand what kind of people they are. &lt;strong&gt;(Delusional)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Bleeding Edge, Nix and Ricing</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 08 Mar 2025 18:40:08 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/bleeding-edge-nix-and-ricing/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/bleeding-edge-nix-and-ricing/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/bleeding-edge-nix-and-ricing/">&lt;p&gt;I love customizing. [&lt;em&gt;Anything, everything but, mostly software.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I like sharing what I have created.
I like showing people how computers can be fun and the fact that there are too many ways we can use it.
And I love living in the bleeding edge of things. [&lt;em&gt;Not cutting edge, &lt;strong&gt;Bleeding&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I like using the
most alpha of the features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUT!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bleeding edge is named for a reason. You never get the &quot;Polished&quot; experience. [&lt;em&gt;That&#x27;s stable software, ugh!.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
You face breakage. You need to handle things yourself, and maybe you need to work around the issues that you know
there will be. [You might bleed.] But that&#x27;s the fun of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nix is one of the best and frkn awesome package managers + configuration tool there is. [&lt;em&gt;One of the best because
there is guix and docker and things I don&#x27;t know about.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I love it. The best feature that nix has, has been an experimental feature
since ages called &#x27;flakes&#x27;. It&#x27;s more streamlined, more portable and more sharable. And it takes it&#x27;s [&lt;em&gt;my&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] time.
Writing things in nix is easy when you are standing on the shoulders of giants but when you have to write it yourself.
It&#x27;ll take time. Making multiple changes also needs multiple checkups and evaluations to complete which is a drawback of
Nix. [&lt;em&gt;Making changes is slow!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricing [&lt;em&gt;For those who don&#x27;t know, is a term for &quot;customizing your desktop&#x2F;interface&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] has been one of my biggest reason
to use Linux. [&lt;em&gt;Also the very first reason.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Making your computer feel like it&#x27;s yours, that&#x27;s ricing. Ricing requires a lot
of hit and trials and changes and rebuilds. It&#x27;s not much of an issue because most configurations live reload. [&lt;em&gt;In normal conditions.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you combine all these three things, having bleeding edge software, using Nix and Ricing. You get my setup. Which is fine
when others reference from my work. But, having packages unavailable for Nix; requires you to build it yourself. [&lt;em&gt;Not in the normal sense of
building, it must be the Nix way.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Then, loving to rice means multiple changes, and with Nix, you can forget lazy loading; enjoy waiting minutes
which would have been done in milliseconds. Overall, it&#x27;s not the best experience ricing in Nix.
[&lt;em&gt;But, Might be the worst when all these things come into play.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that was my morning like today. Ricing on Nix with bleeding edge software. Somehow, I love it. [&lt;em&gt;Both, the journey and the destination.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;stockholm-syndrome&quot;&gt;Stockholm Syndrome&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; indeed!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Meet me if you want to see the rice. ;D&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Two Dreams a Day</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 19:19:13 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/two-dreams-a-day/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/two-dreams-a-day/">&lt;p&gt;For someone who never saw dreams at all [&lt;em&gt;I mean this in a literal sense (in sleep).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I have been
seeing two dreams a day. How do you know when you transition from one dream to another, you ask?
I sleep almost the next day that is 00:00 at midnight and I had put an alarm for 5:30 so that I wake
up early. But, 5~ hours of sleep is not enough, and I always turn my alarm off at 5:30 and sleep again.
So, from 00:00–05:30 I will be seeing one dream [&lt;em&gt;Which I most of the time don&#x27;t remember.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and
from 05:30–08&#x2F;09:00 I dream about something horror&#x2F;horrible because I sleep with a guilt that I
should not have slept. [&lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t keep remembering these dreams I see, but I know that the morning
dreams are almost always something horror.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, from the above text you already know that I am suffering from stage 3 procrastination. [&lt;em&gt;Don&#x27;t
search about it, I made it up.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I procrastinate waking up as well. I consciously know that the thing
I am doing is not good but, I still procrastinate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day has 24 hours and keeping at least 6.5 hours for sleep, the day time is 17.5 hours, which I waste
each day every day by procrastinating. Sometimes I sleep at day even after sleeping 9 hours [&lt;em&gt;from 00:00 to
09:00&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] just because I know that I have to do something but don&#x27;t have the will power to do it. [&lt;em&gt;I just give up
and sleep.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Another way to ignore things is to watch endless feeds, [&lt;em&gt;shorts&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], even YouTube videos, or [&lt;em&gt;frkn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
start watching a series or a movie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that I have time, but I don&#x27;t use it. I don&#x27;t utilize it. I have time to do almost anything I want
from exercising, to going to walk, to writing something, to practicing programming, to tinkering Linux to studying.
I have the time to do all these things and still have time to do extra things. [&lt;em&gt;theoritically&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain rot! It is a problem, I am addicted to my devices, if I turn one off I need to turn another on. [&lt;em&gt;I need to.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Even when going for a walk, I keep checking my steps on my phone. [&lt;em&gt;Which, though is normal, feels bad still.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Some podcast playing, some music in the background, at least something that keeps me stimulated, I need that.
I realize it, I try to fix it, and I get withdrawals. I need to replace these habits with some healthy alternatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO, is the main thing [&lt;em&gt;reason&#x2F;excuse&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] to keep using these feeds, from YouTube or even mastodon. Even though
there is nothing new, I keep on scrolling to find if something new comes up. I do find new things each day but
finding them doesn&#x27;t spark joy. I just find them and move on to searching the next new thing. [&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s endless.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I need to stop fearing and just miss out on things. Adapt a more healthy way of finding new thing from my
friends or people I follow instead. To just miss out would be difficult, but I feel it is necessary. I have accumulated
enough new things that I feel like I need to choose some and master them and just miss out on other things. I feel like
I need to stop giving in on the algorithms and start missing out. [&lt;em&gt;I do know that I miss out on so many trends, just because
I don&#x27;t use Facebook or Instagram or Twitter for that matter. But, even beyond those, I am addicted.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I can[&lt;em&gt;I will!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;change&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; like I always say I will. I want to stop falling to the same traps again and again
and I want to stop making the same mistakes again and again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;STOP! MAKING! THE! SAME! MISTAKES! AGAIN! AND! AGAIN!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Teaching: a failed Profession for Pioneers and Innovators</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 21:36:02 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/teaching-a-failed-profession-for-pioneers-and-innovators/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/teaching-a-failed-profession-for-pioneers-and-innovators/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/teaching-a-failed-profession-for-pioneers-and-innovators/">&lt;p&gt;Teaching [&lt;em&gt;At least in a University&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] is a profession that solely exists to support those who are researching
on their particular field. [&lt;em&gt;That&#x27;s how I think of it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] The thing they teach is the thing they specialize in and are researching on to improve.
Teaching the subject they specialize in can reinforce their own understanding of the field, and having students to teach
means they can also share the possibility of new improvements to their students to test their [&lt;em&gt;student&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] understanding as well as potentially get different
perspectives on it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aimed to be a scientist, and to be one requires a lot of dedication and skill and also a lot of resources and funding to sustain it.
The structure that I have seen fund these scientists is that they teach as their profession in their field and for that the faculty
gets grants to fund their research as well as giving them a salary to sustain [&lt;em&gt;Life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the environment I described should be the norm, and it isn&#x27;t where I live. I have to
tag it as an &lt;strong&gt;Ideal Scenario&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Teachers who should have been the most respected people are almost hated and teaching is seen as a
last option profession.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the fact that teaching is a profession which is very social and almost &quot;open source&quot; with nothing to
hide, and can be modified to fit the needs without restrictions, by any capable teacher. But, its status in the society, even on campuses
is very bad. [&lt;em&gt;unrespectful, untrusted, hurtful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By not making the environment optimal as I have described above [&lt;em&gt;This system is practiced in almost all developed countries.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], we get
teachers who have to repeatedly teach the same course surrounding preformatted
exam question patterns with very little room for letting the teachers explore how they want to teach and how they want to test the
students. Resulting in fewer chances for teacher-student discussion and interaction, and in a monotonous nature that causes teachers to lose interest in teaching itself.
[&lt;em&gt;Repeating the same thing for tens of years is very frustrating; I assume.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And it taking up all the time of the
day, and teachers having to end up tired at night and having to repeat the same cycle again another day just kills the potential of
teaching as a profession for Innovators and Pioneers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student in this system would not want to be a teacher at almost any cost. I have respect for all my teachers who are new and are energetic,
and who are old and have been so frustrated that they lost the fun in teaching and now do not care much. I hope someday this will not be the case,
because I assume that this education structure will only lead the capable teachers and researchers to leave the country searching for a better place
while the students are left to be taught by less capable people, only to end up losing interest and not caring about educating students at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Hopeful!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>How to Securely send Messages</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 22:26:27 +0545</pubDate>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/how-to-securely-send-messaages/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/how-to-securely-send-messaages/">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Here, letterbox is the box that contains the letter not the letterbox of your home, where the
postman puts the letter.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you buy(make) a ton of locks that can be locked without a key but can&#x27;t
be unlocked without your key. [&lt;em&gt;There should only be one key that unlocks the lock
and only you should have it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Then, you distribute your locks everywhere where
your friends who send you important messages live, [&lt;em&gt;distribute them in public, they&#x27;re just locks that
only your key can open.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] maybe send a bag or two of those locks to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sending you a letter ask your friend to quickly lock their letter in a box [&lt;em&gt;becomes letterbox&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] with
their own lock+key that both locks and unlocks the box for convenience.
Then ask them to lock &lt;strong&gt;their key&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; that they used to lock the letter box (letterbox-key) &lt;strong&gt;using the
lock you have given&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, whenever they are sending you a letter.
[&lt;em&gt;The message is secured.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now tell them to parcel the letter [&lt;em&gt;That is locked using their key
and their key is locked with your key&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] in any way they
want because no one except you can unlock that box since only you have the key
to unlock the box to get their key that they used to lock the letter. [&lt;em&gt;You get two boxes,
a box that contains the letter, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; another box that contains the key of your friend
to open the letterbox secured by your lock.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To open the letter you open the lock of the box that contains the letterbox-key using your key.
Then you open the letterbox using the letterbox-key. [&lt;em&gt;then you throw the letterbox lock+key that your
friend used because it&#x27;s only needed once -- like a disposable lock.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And enjoy the letter.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Your friend locked the letter with his own lock+key first because it is easier for them
to lock the letter with their own key, and it&#x27;s simpler to lock that small key
with the lock you&#x27;ve given.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how PGP works. In summary:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You distribute your public &quot;lock&quot; to everyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend uses a temporary lock (symmetric key) to secure their message in a box.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They then secure the key for that temporary lock by locking it with your public lock
(asymmetric encryption).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only you have the key (private key) to open that envelope and retrieve the temporary
key, which then allows you to unlock the box and see the message.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;And that&#x27;s how we send encrypted emails.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>My Domains</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 02 Mar 2025 23:25:19 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/my-domains/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/my-domains/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/my-domains/">&lt;p&gt;It has been some years, maybe 2 ~ 2.5 since I bought my first domain.
And when I bought it, I was super excited about what I could do with this single
one, I could set up mail forwarding, make myself a website, a blog and what not.
It was like owning a place on the internet. [&lt;em&gt;Not the walled garden but the open web.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first domain was &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientiac.space&quot;&gt;scientiac.space&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I chose a space
domain not because .com wasn&#x27;t available, but I wanted it to be unique. [&lt;em&gt;Like, it
was my space in the internet.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I set up almost everything using that domain, everything
I could, I did. I use it as a blog on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientiac.space&quot;&gt;scientiac.space&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and
as public notes [&lt;em&gt;notepad?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;map.scientiac.space&quot;&gt;map.scientiac.space&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and many
other things. While developing the blog, I checked the link preview card by sending the link to
messenger, and I did it so many times that this site got flagged as spam at Facebook.
[&lt;em&gt;Not just facebook, but throughout the whole meta services.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then decided to buy another domain called, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carboxi.de&quot;&gt;carboxi.de&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which
was a cheap domain because of .de, and I wanted it to sound cool. [&lt;em&gt;Like, lobste.rs&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
I used carboxide as the way to share my blog on Facebook. That was all it was used
for, for some time. But, now it is another blog which I use to write without thinking
too much. It also is like a computer club where I give subdomains to my friends to use.
And this domain though it doesn&#x27;t have &lt;code&gt;space&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in it, it has been my safe space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then out of stress I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3o14.com&quot;&gt;3o14.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the middle of my ongoing
exams. I am a nerd and I wanted something that represented me, and it was &#x27;pi&#x27; the letter
that had multiple meanings, not just mathematical [&lt;em&gt;TT&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. I could not just buy pi.com or 14.com
to make it 3.14.com because getting 2 lettered domains is super expensive and difficult. I
thought of 3point14, but that was too long. I came up with 3o14 that looks like 3.14 and is
pronounced 3o14 but represents 3point14.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these places I have on the internet, they are a part of my personality and I don&#x27;t think
that I can ever lose them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Enshittification</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 22:05:29 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/enshittification/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/enshittification/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/enshittification/">&lt;p&gt;I liked to assume that every development in science and tech that goes mainstream are
intentionally good products that solved people&#x27;s problems. Although it isn&#x27;t uncommon to
pay to get a problem solved, the norm of the internet has always been to distribute the
information for free. So, something who previously got information free of cost would not
like paying for the same exact thing. Earning money from a service isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but
when the focus of something is shifted from solving problems to increasing profit, the
quality diminishes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking the free product and making it a paid one [&lt;em&gt;ofcourse the product needs
resources and hard work to build&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], it is instead added with adverts to pay for the users.
In a way it may be a good way to keep the product free and also the users happy, it isn&#x27;t
something that keeps being good as the product needs more funding and more resources, as it
is updated and upgraded. Slowly the ads start to seem like they are the part of the product
and gets more and more closer to the service making it very hard to distinguish, and eventually
making the service&#x2F;product be the problem itself [&lt;em&gt;looking at you meta and google and x and y and z and...&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes with subscriptions, if the service giver has to keep making efforts to provide the
service it makes sense to pay as a subscription, but if it is a product that works without
the provider having to continuously make efforts or use their resources, it doesn&#x27;t make any
sense to make it a subscription. [&lt;em&gt;Looking at you adobe, it would have been fine if it was &quot;
pay to upgrade&quot; to the latest version if I needed the new feature.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing down ads and subscriptions both down the throat of people is the next level of
Enshittification, [&lt;em&gt;yes! You Netflix&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. Microsoft, Meta, even Reddit is not safe from enshittification.
The experience gets worse, but the price keeps on increasing. Yes! it is very difficult to make
money to sustain companies but when the users are hooked to the service&#x2F;product the quality
degrades as the priority now is to make money instead of user satisfaction. The user stay because
other users are there, and the other users stay because the other users are there. [&lt;em&gt;looking at you,
everything that has been enshittified&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not against ads or subscriptions because I love free things and as a student I need them.
But it would be great if there was a clear separation between the ads and the actual thing, like,
i don&#x27;t want to dodge ads while searching for the content, I want the content and it&#x27;s fine to
put some ads in it. And it would be great if the thing I paid for remained usable as it is without
any updates [&lt;em&gt;If the updates were necessary, I would be happy to pay for it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and without having
to constantly connect to the providers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I use Linux, Inkscape and Krita and vim and Firefox, so that I don&#x27;t have to deal with these
things, but seeing this problem creep into Firefox, I wasn&#x27;t very happy. I think focusing on user
experience is better for both the provider and user, but what do I know? I am not a company.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Jokes, Circles and Being Offended</title>
          <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 10:18:41 +0545</pubDate>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/jokes-circles-and-being-offended/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/jokes-circles-and-being-offended/">&lt;p&gt;Jokes, a way to have fun, to make people laugh, almost all the time requires
an element of surprise, something unexpected, something not normal. Jokes
most of the time belong to the intersection of the good bad and the ugly part
of societal norms. The more weight the joke has, the more it&#x27;s trustworthy
the audience needs to be. There aren&#x27;t many jokes that are universally liked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circles, the group of people you surround yourself [&lt;em&gt;(like surrounding)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] with. The people
you know you can trust, or the ones you know about what they like and what they
don&#x27;t, or the ones with whom you feel safe with. These people are an audience who will generally not
get offended by your jokes, because of the fact that they know you [&lt;em&gt;and your intents&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and
you know them [&lt;em&gt;and their intents&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being Offended, the emotional response that occurs when someone feels hurt, insulted, or
upset by something that has been said or done. Jokes are one of the many reasons for people
to feel offended. Normally, &lt;em&gt;down kicking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; offends people because it plays with social taboos,
minorities and societal issues. There is no limit on who can be offended, but it is easier
to offend a person you don&#x27;t know than to offend your friend.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a joke that involves &lt;em&gt;down kicking&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; reaches an audience whom it wasn&#x27;t meant to be,
or it is stripped out of context to only make it as an insult or a generalization, it
becomes a problem. For example: If my friend says that Anything I talked can be boiled
down to three things, &quot;failed feminism, failed exams and failed breakup&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t be
offended but if it came from someone I don&#x27;t know, I will be very concerned that one of
my friend is a bitch and I would be very offended about the statement. [&lt;em&gt;It will be considered
as a statement, not a joke.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jokes have the power to communicate the goods and bads of the society whilst making
people laugh about it. It has the power to act as a protest. It has the
power to say something and make people think about without being harsh. Political jokes
and mockery has been with us from centuries. Jokes about sexism, racism, feminism, superstitions
help spread the narrative of the subjects while making people think about if the mockery
doesn&#x27;t belong to them because they practice the things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, major problem with jokes is that it might trigger people, a mockery could be very
hurtful if it has traumas from the past attached to it. I have been called gay [&lt;em&gt;It was
known to be a thing to be made fun of, to be gay back then when I was in school, at least for my
classmates.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] by the bullies when I was in college, and it was because I used to talk[&lt;em&gt;communicate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] to girls
like they were my friends without thinking they were &quot;girls&quot; which other boys didn&#x27;t do.
It was very demeaning, It went to the point that almost everyone in my class knew me as gay
and had to call me gay if they had to provoke me. Back then, if anyone called me gay, I would
be very offended. [&lt;em&gt;Ofcourse I have grown up from it now.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if there is a trauma attached to the joke people can get offended, but in a circle,
where people know and trust each other, the chances of jokes hurting someone is very minimal.
This is to say that every word that comes out of someone&#x27;s mouth isn&#x27;t what they mean, it
might just be a regular phrase in the circle, which for people outside the circle can feel
offensive.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I know that my friends don&#x27;t intent to hurt me and my feelings and only want to get a laugh
from my &quot;weaknesses&quot; when they make a joke about me, and I do it too, because jokes helps us
remember the mistakes we made, of times when things were bad, it makes us appreciate about who
we are today and who we want to be from that moment.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Happiness is in the Process not the Result</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 20:55:30 +0545</pubDate>

          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/happiness-is-in-the-process-not-the-result/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/happiness-is-in-the-process-not-the-result/">&lt;p&gt;We live our life thinking that one day we will achieve something. But, before even starting
to write this article, or whatever I labelled it, I want to give you the TL;DR. &lt;em&gt;The only thing
that we achieve finally is Death and nothing else.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Everything else? Everything else is what
we live.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to walk, I mean I love to walk [&lt;em&gt;Out of my multiple first loves, it is probably my first, first love.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;],
Haha, giving importance to &quot;first&quot; isn&#x27;t uncommon, but first most of the time is the worst. [&lt;em&gt;And it should be.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
And about walking, I never think how the destination will bring me joy, because the activity [&lt;em&gt;the experience&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] of
just walking gives me the utmost joy. [&lt;em&gt;Better if I have a fried to talk walking with me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;But alone feels great.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I can&#x27;t decide on one, I mean walking is great (for me, you might not like it.).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what I mean is that I love walking, I mean we are happiest when doing things and not (as much) when we
achieve what we ought to. When we want something, we are the happiest when we are pursuing to get it, but it
loses a lot of the essence when we actually get it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I just thought about this, but revenge, the thought of getting a revenge is always the strongest, but after
getting one, it just feels bad. So, kids don&#x27;t take revenge (It&#x27;s a bad thing to do).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t think there is more to write about this, the statement [&lt;em&gt;title&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] gives it all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I&#x27;ll just make a part 2 of this if I come across something else that I can write about it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Goodnight now! ;-)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Die a Hero</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 10:31:00 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/die-a-hero/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/die-a-hero/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/die-a-hero/">&lt;p&gt;To die a hero. This is overanalysing and over generalizing the term Hero. But I
see hero to be someone perfect, who knows every right way to do things. They have this perfect
status that they can do good in every condition in any state of their mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say &quot;Never meet your heroes.&quot; because, yes you are right, they are people too
and they are most likely to make mistakes. And when someone is exposed to only seeing
the best side, the goods, the perfects, it should be very disappointing to them to see
their heroes struggling just like they are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every moment when enjoyed will come to a sad end. The more happy you get, the more able
you&#x27;ll be to be sad. Every sad event in life follows by a happy one and&#x2F;or vice versa.
You save some time, you lose some time because of it. [&lt;em&gt;You automate a 2-minute process
to save time, and you end up losing a day.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think that is why they say, &quot;&lt;strong&gt;You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see
yourself as a villain.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&quot; Because nothing is perfect, no-one is a hero forever. [&lt;em&gt;Unless they
die doing it and is the last thing they were known for.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] To die a natural death always
brings up the chance that you die a villain [&lt;em&gt;And by a villain I don&#x27;t mean someone who
does cruel things, it might just be someone who isn&#x27;t able to live up to the growing standards.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person has gone through drastic moments in their own way, they all have an image
that they successfully defeated their &quot;villain&quot; while living life. They all have one or
the other ability to influence someone&#x27;s life in a good way, making them a hero to them.
And yet, they will never be able to sustain the status for forever.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intent and Communication are vastly separated. [&lt;em&gt;I suppose that is why we expect aliens to
have telepathic abilities to communicate.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Words are lost in translation so much that a
good intent can be communicated badly. [&lt;em&gt;By, this I am not suggesting that every intent is
good and it&#x27;s communication to blame.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] One way or other a hero will die, but if they live
long enough, they might just understand why&#x2F;how villains are born.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Absolutely doesn&#x27;t mean one can&#x27;t be a hero twice. Reborn a hero to die as a villain
again and again.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Pictures Lie</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 20:03:26 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/pictures-lie/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/pictures-lie/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/pictures-lie/">&lt;p&gt;In my previous post titled &lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;exaggeration&quot;&gt;Exaggeration&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I said that I exaggerate things for the sake of letting others feel how I felt about it. Yes, editing pictures is kinda the same as exasurating the details and colors. [&lt;em&gt;By editing I mean only changing colors and cropping, not tampering with the picture itself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I do it too, and I feel like it&#x27;s fine to do so. But, posing and manipulating the events in order to make it look other than it actually is, isn&#x27;t something I like.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We being digital citizens have always changed ourselves when we see a camera. From standing straight without moving in the past times when cameras were slow, to posing and smiling today, we have always changed for the camera. It has become an obvious thing to pose to a camera.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;XD Actually, I initially started writing this article to criticize posing and manipulating the situation to capture a camera pleasing version of the subject but the truth.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that we humans crave attention and acceptance. By being accepted to a group&#x2F;society is how we survived while evolving, making it the main trait of humans. So, it seems fair to make oneself look good [&lt;em&gt;or cool, or attractive, or beautiful&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] when presenting to a social place [&lt;em&gt;&#x2F;media&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s like the concept that if there were no laws against it, too many people would commit crimes. If people didn&#x27;t have to, people wouldn&#x27;t. But, my problem with it is that it changes the memories as it actually was, to something else. We almost never get &quot;authentic&quot; memories, because if there&#x27;s a camera recording them, people change how they behave. [&lt;em&gt;Maybe surveillance isn&#x27;t as bad as I think it is. XD I&#x27;m just joking, it&#x27;s bad.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very long way to say that I like &lt;em&gt;candid&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; pictures, you might think. Yeahh, sorta, but also, I like (to capture)&#x2F;[&lt;em&gt;(the captures of)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] people as they are at the moment; smiling, dancing, even crying because that&#x27;s when we show those emotions as we ourselves are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;This text was also supposed to be about how people never show their real self [&lt;em&gt;we  never present the real truth&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] in the social media, and we should never take the pictures of social media as a reference for how the person is. [&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s merely a depiction of how they want to be  seen at that moment of their life.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all, it&#x27;s justifiable to put pictures that &quot;look&quot; good instead of &quot;truth&quot; [&lt;em&gt;For society as well as for oneself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] because yes! I like to be accepted by people who think what I want to be is cool and yes! I like to remember my past as happy and beautiful, even if it really wasn&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pictures will lie and can lie and will keep on lying, so I choose to meet people instead of their pictures.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; To get a more human understanding of their personality. [&lt;em&gt;To know the people as they are.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Look at me bouncing back and forth on my own opinion, maybe this is what being gray feels like, but I like it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were a superhero, I&#x27;d be called &quot;grayzone&quot;. [&lt;em&gt;or &quot;middleclass&quot; or &quot;brown&quot; because I myself am neither white nor black.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Why I don&#x27;t trust some of my Teachers</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:14:11 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/why-i-dont-trust-some-of-my-teachers/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/why-i-dont-trust-some-of-my-teachers/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/why-i-dont-trust-some-of-my-teachers/">&lt;p&gt;Teachers are one of the most respected people in my opinion. They teach us about
the things we don&#x27;t know, the things we need to know, and the things that we want
to know. They are technically the most trustworthy people. But, I am very
unsatisfied with how some of the teachers of my campus behave and work. My biggest
gripe with my teachers is that they aren&#x27;t passionate about their work. Some teachers
just do not care, and some act like ChatGPT who give answers to every possible question
at an instant even if they aren&#x27;t related to the field and even worse is that they
are highly confident about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complaining about teachers feels very wrong, it makes me feel like a &quot;bad&quot; student.
I wish I could trust each word [&lt;em&gt;Even if not a 100 but 95%&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] from their mouth when
teaching, but that isn&#x27;t possible. [&lt;em&gt;At least I think that isn&#x27;t possible.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I should
not have to cross-check if my teacher said something wrong, and I noted it down, It
should be enough to know the basics about the topic with confidence when they teach it.
This isn&#x27;t much of a big deal when they are teaching their own subjects, which they have
been teaching since ages, but the fact that I know what is correct, and I am being
taught what isn&#x27;t [&lt;em&gt;If only it was that one time.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] makes me super worried about the
validity of everything else I have learned from them. [&lt;em&gt;This made me sound more arrogant
than it should be, I don&#x27;t mean to be arrogant.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing is professionalism, some of my teachers aren&#x27;t professional [&lt;em&gt;In terms
of behaviour.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] at all. Some think they are superior to other teachers and by that power
they can do almost anything. Sometimes students are ignored&#x2F;crushed under the ego of some
teacher. [&lt;em&gt;Which makes me see them in a very negative way, and I don&#x27;t want to feel that way.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
Some of the blames for un-enthusiasm for teaching can be blamed on the system as well, because
the end result is determined solely by tests that don&#x27;t really relate to teacher&#x27;s teaching
methods and how they want to test their students.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers and students are interconnected, one cannot exist without the other. So, not everything
is to be blamed to the teachers. I feel the lack of respect from the students to their teachers.
Arriving in time for the class is one of them. And with my observation, if more students respect
a teacher, more students, arrive on time for their lectures. But when the system is such that teachers
have very little effect on the results of the students they teach, the respect for them immediately
shallows down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a teacher can take tests in their own way and evaluate students for what they have analysed
and came to the conclusion of how they have to test the students and the results depended on how the
students did in the entire semester and not just a 3 hour + 1 hour exam, both the teachers and students
will develop a relation that is respectful as well as collaborative and enthusiastic. This way both
the teacher and students could sustain each other, and even work together to solve new problems they
come across.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the tests done at the end of the semesters just takes away the power of the teacher
to know the understanding of their own students and further degrades the relation of the teacher and
their students. Because, it encourages knowing what to write instead of understanding the subject.
When, sitting through the lectures and solving problems for the assignments though in theory should help a student
to solve real life problems if they come across it. Instead of that, I feel like I am learning to
write things in the exams and forget about them after exam.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all this, there also arrives a question that, if I have to learn about the things I have come to
learn, from my own research at home, or [&lt;em&gt;orrrr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] if I have to just practice the past papers and optimize my writing
according to what it wants, why come to college at all? Why not go there just for the exams? But, yeah
there is a catch there too, I have to attend college just for the sake of attendance because lower
attendance means no entry to the exams.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I just hate sitting through a lecture I have to fact-check afterwards, which doesn&#x27;t give much info
for how to solve the questions for exams because what the lecturer taught doesn&#x27;t align on how we are
tested afterwards, and feeling like I could have learnt a little more or practiced for exams a little more
if only I knew what to learn next for the course (which I can find out myself as well).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lectures are important enough to understand the subject, but not enough to pass the exams. And
Prioritizing exams just cuts off from the learning, understanding and problem-solving aspect of college time.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Also a reason why there aren&#x27;t much published research papers from my uni.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I wrote a follow up to this.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;teaching-a-failed-profession-for-pioneers-and-innovators&quot;&gt;&quot;Teaching: a failed Profession for Pioneers and Innovators&quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Exams: How it has always changed me</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:49:23 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/exams-how-it-has-always-changed-me/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/exams-how-it-has-always-changed-me/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/exams-how-it-has-always-changed-me/">&lt;p&gt;Exams before were not as horror as I feel them now [&lt;em&gt;Engineering? Prolly not just it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].
Though I always, and by always I mean always got sick when exams were near, I never really
was very bad at solving quiestions. [&lt;em&gt;I felt like I understood them and they were easy in
the class itself that I didn&#x27;t really needed to study much during exams.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying and memorizing things was never my forte but I got fine enough grades that I was
counted as one of the good students in the class. I was never brillient and never bad, I
didn&#x27;t really study that much but I wasn&#x27;t out of answers to write as well. I have always
been told that I can be excillent if I &quot;study harder&quot; but I never did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get good grades so all my parents and relatives felt like I could do something in
life that&#x27;d made me better than others. [&lt;em&gt;In other words, they felt like I would be
&quot;sucessful&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I still think that I am a good student and I can get good grades if I study.
But, the reality is different. I am addicted to ignoring the subjects if I have to give
exams on them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that I feel that I am someone who should get good grades and I am failing subjects
in the engineering course that I chose and love says so much about me and my study habit.
Which isn&#x27;t a habit because I almost rarely &quot;study&quot;. I explore the internet, I get facinated
by the people and things they can do, and wish that I could do those things too. But I am
afraid to try because if I feel like I failed when I put the effort the &quot;Good Student&quot; in me
is going to die.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I study and still fail the exams I would be someone dumb. I leave the possibility that if
I had studied I would have passed and the reason I failed is that I hadn&#x27;t studied. Though I
can write about and and am conscious about it, I have never made myself get up and do something
about it. Sometimes it makes me feel like it is too late and my brain has matured that it cannot
mould itself to learn new things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever exams arrive I get super active and I am able to do the project I always wanted to do.
Or I watch the movies that I kept aside saying they took a lot my time from study hours, [&lt;em&gt;And still not
studying.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I try to minimize every distractions from my phone and everywhere and slowly within
few days I have everything enabled again. I try to study for an hour and fall into a deep rabbithole
of researching about this new interesting thing I found and forget about what I studied. [&lt;em&gt;And the
fact that I had to study as well.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that, being conscious about everything I am not able to change myself, and
I feel like it&#x27;s too late every time. Every exams I think about these things and fail, and this
is the 6th semester I am at. Meaning I have been the same person for 2.5, almost 3 years with
no change. [&lt;em&gt;And by change I mean improvement, because I have degraded from everything I used
to do before as well and that wasn&#x27;t really the change in me I was looking for.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I have lost at everything I hoped would build me up for the past three years and I am scared
that I wont be able to change. I am scared that I won&#x27;t ever be like the kid people saw in me
before. I am scared that I could never satisfy myself by being what I want to be and I keep hoping
and not doing anything about it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I keep wishing for things instead of working for it. I think I need to develop a habit of
working but I am very bad at it. Ironically, I who think that change is the best thing a human
can do, haven&#x27;t changed to what I want to be. I don&#x27;t want to repeat this the next time I am
near an exam.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Also, weirdly enough I am having an anger issue which I never used to have. I feel like I am
crossing the limit. I don&#x27;t want to see myself as pathetic anymore. I hope the ones who are reading
this would see the change in me. I&#x27;ll work on it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

sometimes develop a psychological bond with their captors.[&lt;em&gt;Straight outa wikipedia. ; )&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I personally learned about it from the show &#x27;Money Heist&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I am talking about it is, like most of the time, I relate it to tech I
use. Nix, an operating system, a package manager and a [&lt;em&gt;FUNCTIONAL&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] programming language.
It is a thing that I love as of right now in the linux&#x2F;*nix world [&lt;em&gt;*nix because it works on
macs as well&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] but, today when I was chatting on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;YaLTeR&#x2F;niri&quot;&gt;niri&#x27;s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; [&lt;em&gt;it&#x27;s a wayland compositor&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] matrix
and YaLTeR who is the main developer of niri mentioned that our relation with nix is giving
the syndrome&#x27;s vibes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it and it really made sense. It is difficult to use for some time until
you get the hang of it. Then it gets super easy, installing packages and starting services
will be a breeze. Then when it comes to ricing and things that are done with hit and trial,
rebuilding the entire config each time [&lt;em&gt;which takes a lot of time&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] gets frustrating. And
don&#x27;t even ask how to get something running if a package you need isn&#x27;t already packaged for nix. [&lt;em&gt;Which is very rare but
it&#x27;s not as simple as following instructions from that package&#x27;s repo.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew about these issues before I even felt like nix was easy [&lt;em&gt;and by easy I mean, by practice
not inherently easy like Ubuntu&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and was something to keep using, it was kinda like a prison back then,
but now I feel like I cannot use any computer without it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I guess it is Stockholm syndrome indeed. XD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Minimalism with Personality</title>
          <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 23:43:37 +0545</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/minimalism-with-personality/">&lt;p&gt;Modern logos and design rely heavily on simplification of everything.
This site being one of the examples. I do like a minimalistic design.
But when it comes to uniqueness and personality of something, things
turn a different way. The more minimal we go the more general and bland
it gets. It&#x27;ll lack the [&lt;em&gt;personality&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] of it to show it&#x27;s difference
from others. While a maximalist approach would include tiniest of details
to make it more unique and personal than ever, a minimal design would take
some very clever tricks to achieve uniqueness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is directly inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manuelmoreale.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;manu&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&#x27;s
site but I wanted to add my own touch to it as he also has given to it.
I wouldn&#x27;t say his site lacks personality because I loved the design and
the minimalistic approach of his site that I wanted one for myself too.
But, to make my site more personal and unique in itself I added a handwriting
style text for my inner voice [&lt;em&gt;inner voice... [&lt;em&gt;inner voice...&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] for the
things I think while writing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this logo. It is made up of completely straight lines. It&#x27;s
minimal as well as unique. [&lt;em&gt;This is scientiac&#x27;s logo and he talks about it
whenever he gets the chance to. He is very proud of it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;select id=&quot;themeSelect&quot; style=&quot;appearance: none; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;select&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;!-- Image element. The src URL includes the selected theme in its name --&gt;
&lt;img id=&quot;themeImage&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientiac.space&#x2F;res&#x2F;colors&#x2F;logo-everforest-light.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:40%;&quot; alt=&quot;Theme logo&quot;&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  &#x2F;&#x2F; Get references to the select element and image
  const themeSelect = document.getElementById(&#x27;themeSelect&#x27;);
  const themeImage = document.getElementById(&#x27;themeImage&#x27;);

  &#x2F;&#x2F; Update image based on the user&#x27;s theme selection
  themeSelect.addEventListener(&#x27;change&#x27;, function() {
    const selectedTheme = themeSelect.value;
    &#x2F;&#x2F; Construct the new image URL using the selected theme
    const newUrl = `https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scientiac.space&#x2F;res&#x2F;colors&#x2F;logo-${selectedTheme}.svg`;
    themeImage.style.opacity = 0;
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      themeImage.src = newUrl;
      themeImage.style.opacity = 1;
    }, 200);
  });
&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, thinking about personality, I sometimes wish that apples were rainbow
colored and the window glasses were tinted with colors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;A colorful place for colorful minds.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, [&lt;em&gt;(&quot;but&quot; strikes back)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]  I love a good minimalist approach of things.
I like the new mozilla logo. I like the fact how the new Pepsi&#x27;s logo look
and yes I do love GNOME&#x27;s foot. [&lt;em&gt;(Wouldn&#x27;t call it a fetish though. XD)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Because they have their quirks and their own personalities.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Civilization</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:37:56 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/civilization/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/civilization/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/civilization/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;civilization&quot;&gt;Civilization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, currently referred to the state of a group of
people not being savage, cruel or inhuman. [&lt;em&gt;it directly relates to being human in behaviour&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
We now describe a civilization by comparing it to when people stopped behaving like savages and
started living in a society with its rules and norms for the betterment of all the people in the
group. As the humans progressed in the world and became more and more social and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;civil&quot;&gt;civil&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
[&lt;em&gt;polite&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], and as we are progressing in this state, many people are developing backwards too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some [&lt;em&gt;in context, [&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;too many&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] people are showing their &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;barbaric&quot;&gt;barbaric&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nature these days.
Harassments, rapes, murders and other cruel incidents are not new but, they are hitting out eyes and ears
very often. We might associate these things with the development of communication systems, but in my opinion
these incidents [&lt;em&gt;previously&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] didn&#x27;t see the light of the day [&lt;em&gt;were buried&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] for the sake of seeming &lt;strong&gt;civilized&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Thankfully,
we ourselves can mediate an incident to a huge mass because of the social media and hence, we are seeing the true
nature of these people. We can safely assume that we live in a society where there are very many uncivilized people
than we currently suspect there are.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Power&quot; a vague word, representing status, richness, strength, authority, connections, prestige, heritage and a lot of things has become
the biggest cause of the barbaric nature of people. Discrimination as always been the issue, because we have differences,
we also have freedom, but the imbalance of power causes it more than regular human [&lt;em&gt;uncontrollable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] differences. Entitled
people who think they are above anything [&lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] mostly want their position to be the same and don&#x27;t want people growing,
going against them. This makes them feel powerful and hence misusing this power they try to get away with uncivilized things.
How do you think corruption increases? And the more corruption there is, the more &lt;em&gt;hiding of crimes&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; will happen [&lt;em&gt;because, yes!
Nobody wants to seem uncivilized&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;corruption&quot;&gt;Corruption&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, meaning to decay [&lt;em&gt;to rot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], or as we know today by the
act of misusing the power for the good of oneself [&lt;em&gt;preserving one&#x27;s civilness&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] hiding from the law, has become the main cause for the increase in barbaric
nature of people. If the whole system is corrupt the whole society has to adapt to it, and if the society adapts to a corrupt
system, people don&#x27;t see the law as law but, a list of what to hide and what to show to look civil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reputation plays a vital role in a society to make and break people. To be a reputed person, the person needs to become
civil as well as powerful, and to lose reputation losing one of those two traits is enough. Social humiliation is the worst
nightmare of people, and they will do anything to not let it happen. But in an uncivilized corrupt society reputation can be
bought with enough power [&lt;em&gt;or money&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. And hence, no matter how civilized a society, a city, a country may seem; no matter
how proud they seem, no matter how rich they seem, if they are corrupt they will never be a civilization. And as long as
the people in power are corrupt, the people who are actually civil will never get &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;justice&quot;&gt;justice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;realization&quot;&gt;Realization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for corrupt people requires extremes [&lt;em&gt;extreme conditions&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. They don&#x27;t
relate to the pain that others are facing. To realize they need someone close to them to go through the same pain or someone to &#x27;die&#x27;
and for people to assure them that that shouldn&#x27;t have happened. I don&#x27;t think these people realize that justice can never be served to a
dead person. From hiding crimes to letting them happen, the reputed but, corrupt people of our society have always gotten away with
these things. And people can never be safe nor feel safe under a corrupt system which fakes its barbaric nature with a cloak of civilization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Why did I write this?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Because, I live in a such a country which neighbors another such country.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Nobody is safe here, and justice for our people is just a myth.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Quiet</title>
          <pubDate>Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:24:53 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/quiet/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/quiet/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/quiet/">&lt;p&gt;I was quiet for two days, not because I didn&#x27;t feel like writing, because
I was writing a poem but decided to give up. It didn&#x27;t feel good to write
about rage, about hatred. I have always tried to see the good qualities in
people. Everyone believes that they are good people in their mind. Nobody
[&lt;em&gt;Maybe some, but mostly nobody.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] does something because they feel that they
are bad, and they need to keep it that way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still like seeing the good in people no matter how they are depicted by the
society or a group. Though I have realized that looking at the bads of people
is necessary too. Also, the idea of good and bad is subjective to individuals.
Something that I find to be &quot;good&quot; may be &quot;bad&quot; in the eyes of others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example; I find the idea of using the modern social media to be bad, but
there are people who will defend using these media against the problem of FOMO
and relevance. [&lt;em&gt;And looking from their glasses, I can see that I miss out a
lot of context in people&#x27;s conversations just because I don&#x27;t use what they do.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the need of remaining quiet. Just to soak everything up, to listen and
analyze the context. I feel the need of being quiet and stop talking about the
lives of other people. I know that we are social creatures and, especially humans,
we crave connection and validation. That&#x27;s why we talk, we share our point of
views, mostly to people that we know will like our view, or so-called good people
[&lt;em&gt;I being one.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] who won&#x27;t feel the need to object the opinion to hurt other&#x27;s
feelings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always said that I am a man of science, I look at the facts, the truths,
I like to look people in context of the human psychology instead of something like
spirituality. I tend to prioritize facts over feelings, but since I am a human
myself and, I am going through a phase where my brain is constantly remembering the
memories which when I think about logically should be something to be forgotten
or ignored. I have come to the realization that we are not completely in control
of ourselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to do things that might hurt others, subconsciously. It just happens.
Sometimes seeing someone hurt gives a feeling of validation [&lt;em&gt;Like, they deserved
it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] instead of feeling bad about something bad happening to them and you being
its cause. I have some very bad opinions about some people, which may be true in the
context of me, but for anyone who isn&#x27;t related to it, it doesn&#x27;t matter. And I
try to remain quiet about those things, and saying my opinions to people about other
people. [&lt;em&gt;Which I mostly fail to do, because when the feelings hit, I just can&#x27;t stop.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
I debate with myself about what is right and what is wrong but at the end, I end up
in rage and anger and to minimize it I seek validation and the quietness in me just
disappears.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be quiet is never to ignore something, it&#x27;s to take it in and not let things out.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;***&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Hence, I need to respect my own definition and learn to be quiet.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Love is Fear</title>

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/love-is-fear/">&lt;p&gt;If Friday the thirteenth is considered scary to be spent alone, I guess February the thirteenth would be the version 2.0 of it. [&lt;em&gt;Well if you feel lonely that is.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Let&#x27;s come to the seriousness of the topic. [&lt;em&gt;Sike! did you think I&#x27;d be serious about it?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But, maybe I&#x27;ll be. I am just starting to write this [&lt;em&gt;Breaking the forth wall?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. I had thought of writing about this topic a while ago today, but I put it on &lt;em&gt;note to self&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and  now that I&#x27;m trying to write about it, I can&#x27;t think much. I mean, the thing is,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like form follows function, love follows fear. [&lt;em&gt;Fear determines the trajectory of love.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phases, when you feel the things, you are in constant fear, do they even like you. Saying [&lt;em&gt;showing*, actually&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] the love you feel, you&#x27;re in fear, will they even consider you? Dating [&lt;em&gt;doing things together&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;], do they even like the way you do things? Final phase [&lt;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] do they even think that you are for them? Yeah, all of these if &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; are in love.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is it&#x27;s not easy to know if someone with you actually loves you.` [&lt;em&gt;For me personally, the verbal expression of love, makes it more and more suspicious if they actually don&#x27;t.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I mean maybe it&#x27;s only me who feels like this but, not being able to know if someone actually does love you is a pain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope tomorrow will be as regular as it can get. These thoughts have just been amplified by the fact that it&#x27;s the &quot;scary&quot; February the thirteenth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t feel anything this valentine, it&#x27;s a normal day without a meaning for me while it was different in the before years.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Expert</title>
          <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:14:19 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/expert/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/expert/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/expert/">&lt;p&gt;Expert is someone who has made all the mistakes there is to make in a particular field.
I forgot who said this but it made so much sense. We wish to be experts , we wish to
know everything there is to know about something that interests us, but we humans are
lazy animals. We are evolutionarily lazy. We try to conserve our energy and only use
it when we absolutely need it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might have been a survival strategy for out ansistors, they had to search day and
night for food travelling long distances,so they developed a brain to conserve energy
to use when it is necessary for survival, like running away from a preditor [&lt;em&gt;idk..
maybe swimming through the rivers&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] or collecting food from trees or hunting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#x27;s world we dont have to do any of those things. We are safe in our houses,
we get food from the market and eat, we use the means of transportation to travel.
[&lt;em&gt;We can even fly without losing any energy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Just to live, we dont have to do much.
[&lt;em&gt;not, as much&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] So, the only important thing for us is to use our brain to learn
things hoping to make or discover or invent new things from the informaton we have
gained [&lt;em&gt;probably, something to make our life more easier&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the problem comes here; thinking and learning weren&#x27;t the survival strategies
we evloved with. But, in this age those are the most important skills to have, but
our brain doesn&#x27;t give them much importance. [&lt;em&gt;I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with me
too.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] The ability to control our mind [&lt;em&gt;sounds preposterous, right? controlling
the very thing that controls us.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] is the most important survival strategy and it
is very difficult because we aren&#x27;t evolved with that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t just say that only evolution affects lazyness, because, the other thing is
the environment we grow up in [&lt;em&gt;the modern world&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. The brain develops learning
things from this environment, the rights and wrongs, the goods and bads and the
grays and everything else. [&lt;em&gt;adaptaiton is the other main player in this, not just
evolution&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;I mean, it&#x27;s like evolution but hapenning very fast.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
And I believe that we all should learn to control our own minds, to focus on something
[&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] from a younger age [&lt;em&gt;we should be taught to do that&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;].&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To not give up and to keep making mistakes is the survival strategy.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;PS: It was Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist, who said&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expert is a person who has found out by his own painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/ignorance/">&lt;p&gt;With communication now happens to be digital first, and social second, ignoring
has become a problem. While children grow up in a world where it is fine to ignore
texts and messages, those traits also follow to the real world. And since there is
an information overload the first thing to grasp someone&#x27;s mind is validated so much
that it becomes the truth to that individual person, and no signs of crossthinking
and assuming there are alternatives and counterarguments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any criticizm seems like it is a personal attack to the persons beliefs. &lt;em&gt;I am just
what I am&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;I like the way I am&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] is the biggest excuse for people. [&lt;em&gt;Like, sure but that&#x27;s what an animal
without a brain, [&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;(I mean conscience)&lt;em&gt;] would also think of itself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] Having a brain
means you can think and reason, because you&#x27;ll be validated by the internet for almost
anything you think of and validation is like privacy nowadays. [&lt;em&gt;Just a concept.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a tech guy. [&lt;em&gt;I must have repeated this phrase many times and will go on to do so.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
And I am very interested by how we can send data from one place to another in
different ways, and in speed. [&lt;em&gt;And by speed, I mean instantly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and the fact that
these messages are ignored because, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because, it&#x27;s the norm now.
[&lt;em&gt;Message come and go, they doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the problem isn&#x27;t ignoring messages[&lt;em&gt;I do it too.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;],
the problem is ignoring questions. And it isn&#x27;t just via the internet,
or messages. I see people just ignoring the person infront of them and not speaking and
just flat out refusing to acknowledge that the person exists in front of them. It&#x27;s
ghosting but standing in front of the person and making them feel like a ghost [&lt;em&gt;someone
who doesn&#x27;t exist&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. I see this in teenagers today and I know that &lt;strong&gt;Juvenoya&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Man it feels bad to feel like a ghost.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Lastly, nothing makes me furiating other than someone not replying to me when I ask something,
be it via texts or in real life.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;Might also because I invest so much of time thinking
about communication software.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Like, just say that you don&#x27;t know if you don&#x27;t know.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;Not saying anything doesn&#x27;t help!!!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Exaggeration</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:49:15 +0545</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/exaggeration/">&lt;p&gt;Exaggeration is necessary sometimes. There are things worth sharing,
but sometimes [&lt;em&gt;actually, most fot he times&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] they are boring.
Sometimes they can mean a lot to you, but may not be touching for
other people. So, to convey how you feel about something with the
same weight that you feel it, exaggeration is  necessary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a credible person while sharing facts, but when it
comes to my daily life, I add one to most of the things while telling
it to someone. Because, the exact thing that happened doesn&#x27;t matter.
What matters is how you feel [&lt;em&gt;likee, you should feel how I felt when
living that moment.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] about what I am saying. [&lt;em&gt;By, telling tthis
I might have lsot my credibility a little.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;But, look I tell you the
truth.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s not like I am lying to you.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, for instance, I would say that I solved like 10 bugs today, but in reality
I may have only solved 8 of them. [&lt;em&gt;Real life clickbait, I guess.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] But, this is
a simple example. The amount I exaggerate is directly proportional to the way I
am feeling about it. [&lt;em&gt;Like, I would say that I hate someone, but in rality I might
just don&#x27;t like them.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] So yeah, that&#x27;s the whole point I wanted to make. I feel
like I should not have made this point though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Please don&#x27;t subtract &quot;two&quot; from what I am saying, just because I said all this.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;I feel like you&#x27;d do that now.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;I only want you to feel it the way I felt it...&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;( ^◡^)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>What you Want</title>

          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/what-you-want/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;aaaactuallllly-earn-what-you-want&quot;&gt;[&lt;em&gt;aaaactuallllly, EARN* what you want&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you can get what you want just by asking for it
is calming and dangerous at the same time. And when you get what
you want just by asking for it, [&lt;em&gt;stratigecally or politely&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] it
takes no time to get addicted to the comfort of asking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple reminder that what you&#x27;ve got now is just something that
can be taken back by the person who gave it to you will keep you
on your toes grounded [&lt;em&gt;and frightened&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. And that is a good thing.
[&lt;em&gt;only if you &lt;del&gt;remember&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; realize it.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things can be owned by two ways, [&lt;em&gt;fortunately&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] the other way is
by earning. And this is probably the most important thing to
remember because, what you&#x27;ve earned yourself can&#x27;t be taken by
someone else. [&lt;em&gt;except for thieves :x&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have gotten a lot of things by just asking for it, [&lt;em&gt;sometimes
I forget that words are magic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] from &lt;em&gt;&quot;things&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;hardware&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] to
&lt;em&gt;&quot;love&quot;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;software?  (´ᴗ`‘)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. The thing that I have realized from
my experiances is that [&lt;em&gt;like other things that I try to do myself
until it is not possible&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] I have to get things by earning things
myself. [&lt;em&gt;I have said &quot;&quot;things&quot;&quot; so many times, it has stopped making sense XDXD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Quit asking! unless urgent?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;Asking is necessary, but only when it
is a necessity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Nights now! zZz&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Life of Hate</title>
          <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 15:10:29 +0545</pubDate>
          <author>flux</author>
          <link>https://flux.carboxi.de/life-of-hate/</link>
          <guid>https://flux.carboxi.de/life-of-hate/</guid>
          <description xml:base="https://flux.carboxi.de/life-of-hate/">&lt;p&gt;The thing about hate is that it lasts as long as the person wants it to last.
I have learned to hate things [&lt;em&gt;I wasn&#x27;t like this before&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] and the more you
think about it the more hateful stuff you notice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take microsoft windows for instance, I haven&#x27;t even used it nicely [&lt;em&gt;yeah I am a linux guy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] but
I know so many points [&lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] to hate it, and once I made my mind saying I hated it, I found more
and more things to hate it even more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is also a strong word. And it is &lt;strong&gt;Heavy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Like love, hate also loses
it&#x27;s meaning if used too often and too many times. [&lt;em&gt;I have used &quot;too&quot; here, don&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t,
too much of anything is bad.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] And that is why I want the things I hate to be small and meaningful
[&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s kinda like unblocking some people on &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your social media here&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; because the blocklist is getting crowded.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]
[&lt;em&gt;What do you mean you&#x27;ve never done it?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] .&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with hating, forgiving is essential too. And letting people know what they have
done wrong to deserve hatred is one of the best things that can be done [&lt;em&gt;Also one of the
toughest things though&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]. So, the life [&lt;em&gt;As in, something with life ends faster than something with half-life.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] of hate is as long as you want it to be and so is
the life of love. [&lt;em&gt;But we are talking about hate, here.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I am talking about hate and love here, it isn&#x27;t really binary. You can have a bit of
both in something like, I love NixOS [&lt;em&gt;It&#x27;s a linux distro.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] but I hate it because it sometimes
makes a simple things complicated. [&lt;em&gt;I mean, it&#x27;ll be doable.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;But, at what cost?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;Time!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough of this talking, I have work to do. Lastly, learning to hate is essential, because it
has a purpose and like love. [&lt;em&gt;I am feeling&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;cringe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;] [&lt;em&gt;while writing &quot;love&quot; but not &quot;hate&quot;, ohhh me.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Love a little hate a little more. XD&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
